If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then the UE shall ignore the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any. 1)\tAdditionally, if the ESM cause value is #32 \"service option not supported\", or #33 \"requested service option not subscribed\", the UE shall proceed as follows: -\tif the UE is registered in the HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present), the UE shall behave as described above in the present clause, using the configured SM_RetryWaitTime value as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A] or in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17], if available, as back-off timer value; and NOTE\u00a00:\tThe way to choose one of the configured SM_RetryWaitTime values for back-off timer value is up to UE implementation if the UE is configured with:\n-\tan SM_RetryWaitTime value in ME as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A]; and\n-\tan SM_RetryWaitTime value in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]. -\totherwise, if the UE is not registered in its HPLMN or a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present) or the SM_RetryWaitTime value is not configured, the UE shall behave as described above in the present clause, using the default value of 12 minutes for the back-off timer. 2)\tFor ESM cause values different from #32 \"service option not supported\", or #33 \"requested service option not subscribed\", the UE behaviour regarding the start of a back-off timer is specified in clause\u00a06.3.6. The UE shall not stop any back-off timer upon a PLMN change or inter-system change. If the network indicates that a back-off timer for the bearer resource modification procedure and PLMN and APN combination is deactivated, then it remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change. NOTE\u00a01:\tThis means the back-off timer can still be running or be deactivated for the given ESM procedure and PLMN and APN combination when the UE returns to the PLMN or when it performs inter-system change back from A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode to S1 mode. Thus the UE can still be prevented from sending another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message with exception of those identified in clause\u00a06.5.4.1, in the PLMN for the same APN. If the back-off timer is started upon receipt of BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT (i.e. the timer value was provided by the network, a configured value is available or the default value is used as explained above) or the back-off timer is deactivated, the UE behaves as follows: 1)\tafter a PLMN change the UE may send a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same APN in the new PLMN, if the back-off timer is not running and is not deactivated for the bearer resource modification procedure and the combination of new PLMN and APN; Furthermore as an implementation option, for the ESM cause values #32 \"service option not supported\" or #33 \"requested service option not subscribed\", if the network does not include a Re-attempt indicator IE, the UE may decide not to automatically send another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same APN that was sent by the UE, if the UE is registered to a new PLMN which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs. 2)\tif the network does not include the Re-attempt indicator IE to indicate whether re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode is allowed, or the UE ignores the Re-attempt indicator IE, e.g. because the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then: -\tif the UE is registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present), the UE shall apply the configured SM_RetryAtRATChange value as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A] or in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17], if available, to determine whether the UE may attempt a PDP context modification procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in A/Gb or Iu mode or a PDU session modification procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in N1 mode; and NOTE\u00a02:\tThe way to choose one of the configured SM_RetryAtRATChange values for back-off timer value is up to UE implementation if the UE is configured with: -\tan SM_RetryAtRATChange value in ME as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A]; and -\tan SM_RetryAtRATChange value in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]. -\tif the UE is not registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present), or if the NAS configuration MO as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] is not available and the value for inter-system change is not configured in the USIM file NASCONFIG, then the UE behaviour regarding a PDP context modification procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in A/Gb or Iu mode and a PDU session modification procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in N1 mode are unspecified; and 3)\tif the network includes the Re-attempt indicator IE indicating that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not allowed, then depending on the timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE, for each combination of a PLMN from the equivalent PLMN list and the APN the UE shall start a back-off timer for the bearer resource modification procedure with the value provided by the network, or deactivate the respective back-off timer as follows: -\tif the Re-attempt indicator IE additionally indicates that re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode is allowed, the UE shall start or deactivate the back-off timer for S1 mode only; and -\totherwise the UE shall start or deactivate the back-off timer for A/Gb, Iu, S1 and N1 mode. If the back-off timer for a PLMN and APN combination was started or deactivated upon receipt of an MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REJECT message (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13]) and the network indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is allowed, then this back-off timer does not prevent the UE from sending a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode. If the network indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is not allowed, the UE shall not send any BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode until the timer expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed. If a back-off timers for a PLMN and APN combination, in combination with any S-NSSAI or without S-NSSAI (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54]) was started or deactivated in N1 mode upon receipt of a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54]) and the network indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is allowed, then this back-off timer does not prevent the UE from sending a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode. If the network indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is not allowed, the UE shall not send any BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode until the timer expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed. If more than one back-off timer for the same PLMN and APN combination was started in N1 mode with an indication from the network that re-attempt in S1 mode is not allowed and no back-off timer for the same PLMN and APN combination was deactivated in N1 mode, the UE shall not send any BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode until all timers have expired. If at least one back-off timer for the same PLMN and APN combination was deactivated in N1 mode, the UE shall not send any BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed. NOTE\u00a03:\tThe back-off timer is used to describe a logical model of the required UE behaviour. This model does not imply any specific implementation, e.g. as a timer or timestamp. NOTE\u00a04:\tReference to back-off timer in this section can either refer to use of timer T3396 or to use of a different packet system specific timer within the UE. Whether the UE uses T3396 as a back-off timer or it uses different packet system specific timers as back-off timers is left up to UE implementation. This back-off timer is stopped when the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed. The further actions to be performed by the UE are implementation dependent as part of upper layers responsibility.",

    "text": "The network may include a back-off timer value in an EPS session management reject message to regulate the time interval at which the UE may retry the same procedure. For ESM cause values other than #26 \"insufficient resources\", the network may also include the re-attempt indicator to indicate whether the UE is allowed to re-attempt the corresponding session management procedure for the same  in A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode after inter-system change. NOTE\u00a01:\tIf the network includes this back-off timer value, then the UE is blocked from sending another ESM request for the same procedure for the same PLMN and  combination for the specified duration. Therefore, the operator needs to exercise caution in determining the use of this timer value. NOTE\u00a02:\tIf the re-attempt indicator is not provided by the network, a UE registered in its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present) can use the configured SM_RetryAtRATChange value specified in the NAS configuration MO or in the USIM NASCONFIG file to derive the re-attempt indicator as specified in clauses\u00a06.5.1.4.3, 6.5.3.4.3, and 6.5.4.4.3. If re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode is allowed, the UE shall consider the back-off timer to be applicable only to the EPS session management in S1 mode for the rejected EPS session management procedure and the given PLMN and  combination. If re-attempt in A/Gb and Iu mode and N1 mode is not allowed, the UE shall consider the back-off timer to be applicable to all three NAS protocols, i.e. applicable to the EPS session management in S1 mode for the rejected EPS session management procedure, to the GPRS session management in A/Gb and Iu mode for the corresponding session management procedure and the given PLMN and  combination and to the 5GS session management in N1 mode for the corresponding session management procedure and the given PLMN and APN combination. NOTE\u00a03:\tIn the present clause the terms APN and DNN are referring to the same parameter. The APN of the PLMN and APN combination associated with the back-off timer is the APN provided by the UE when the PDN connection is established. If no APN is included in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST or, when applicable, in the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message, then the back-off timer is associated with the combination of the PLMN and no APN. For this purpose the UE shall memorize the APN provided to the network during the PDN connection establishment. The back-off timer associated with the combination of a PLMN with no APN will never be started due to any ESM procedure related to an emergency PDN connection. If the back-off timer associated with the combination of a PLMN with no APN is running, it does not affect the ability of the UE to request an emergency PDN connection. The network may additionally indicate in the re-attempt indicator that a command to back-off is applicable not only for the PLMN in which the UE received the EPS session management reject message, but for each PLMN included in the equivalent PLMN list at the time when the EPS session management reject message was received. If the back-off timer is running or is deactivated for a given PLMN and APN combination, and the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 \u2013 15 in selected PLMN, then the UE is allowed to initiate an attach procedure or any EPS session management procedure for this PLMN and APN combination. If the network does not include a back-off timer with ESM cause value #29 \"insufficient resources\", #30 \"request rejected by Serving GW or PDN GW\", #31 \"request rejected, unspecified\", #34 \"service option temporarily out of order\", or #38 \"network failure\", the UE may use a local back-off timer that has exponential value or a default value, which is provisioned using implementation specific means, to: -\tprevent sending the rejected ESM procedure for the respective APN till its expiry; and -\tallow sending the rejected ESM procedure for the respective APN after its expiry.",

The UE shall not request the use of eDRX during: -\tan attach for emergency bearer services procedure; -\ta tracking area updating procedure for the UE attached for emergency bearer services; or -\tan attach for access to RLOS. The UE and the network may negotiate eDRX parameters during a tracking area updating procedure when the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services. The network accepts the request to use the eDRX by providing the extended DRX parameters IE when accepting the attach or the tracking area updating procedure. The UE shall use eDRX only if it received the extended DRX parameters IE during the last attach or tracking area updating procedure and the UE does not have a PDN connection for emergency bearer services.

    "old_text": "If the tracking area update request has been accepted by the network, the MME shall send a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message to the UE. If the MME assigns a new GUTI for the UE, a GUTI shall be included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. In this case, the MME shall start timer T3450 and enter state EMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in subclause\u00a05.4.1. The MME may include a new TAI list for the UE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE has included the UE network capability IE or the MS network capability IE or both in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall store all octets received from the UE, up to the maximum length defined for the respective information element. NOTE\u00a01:\tThis information is forwarded to the new MME during inter-MME handover or to the new SGSN during inter-system handover to A/Gb mode or Iu mode. If a UE radio capability information update needed IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall delete the stored UE radio capability information, if any. If the UE specific DRX parameter was included in the DRX Parameter IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the network shall replace any stored UE specific DRX parameter with the received parameter and use it for the downlink transfer of signalling and user data. If an EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall deactivate all those EPS bearer contexts locally (without peer-to-peer signalling between the MME and the UE) which are active on the network side, but are indicated by the UE as being inactive. If a default EPS bearer context is marked as inactive in the EPS bearer context status IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and this default bearer is not associated with the last PDN of the user in the MME, the MME shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE. If the EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST, the MME shall include an EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, indicating which EPS bearer contexts are active in the MME. If the EPS update type IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message indicates \"periodic updating\", and the UE was previously successfully attached for EPS and non-EPS services, subject to operator policies the MME should allocate a TAI list that does not span more than one location area. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains T3412 extended value IE, then the UE shall use the T3412 extended value IE as periodic tracking area update timer (T3412). If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT contains T3412 value IE, but not T3412 extended value IE, then the UE shall use value in T3412 value IE as periodic tracking area update timer (T3412). If neither T3412 value IE nor T3412 extended value IE is included, the UE shall use the value currently stored, e.g. from a prior ATTACH ACCEPT or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. Also during the tracking area updating procedure without \"active\" flag, if the MME has deactivated EPS bearer context(s) locally for any reason, the MME shall inform the UE of the deactivated EPS bearer context(s) by including the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If due to regional subscription restrictions or access restrictions the UE is not allowed to access the TA, but it has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the MME may accept the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and deactivate all non-emergency EPS bearer contexts by initiating an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure when the TAU is initiated in EMM-CONNECTED mode. When the TAU is initiated in EMM-IDLE mode, the MME locally deactivates all non-emergency EPS bearer contexts and informs the UE via the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The MME shall not deactivate the emergency EPS bearer contexts. The network shall consider the UE to be attached for emergency bearer services only and shall indicate in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is not activated. If a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received from a UE with a LIPA PDN connection, and if: -\ta GW Transport Layer Address IE value identifying a L-GW is provided by the lower layer together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the P-GW address included in the EPS bearer context of the LIPA PDN Connection is different from the provided GW Transport Layer Address IE value (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[36]); or -\tno GW Transport Layer Address is provided together with the tracking area update request by the lower layer, then the MME locally deactivates all EPS bearer contexts associated with the LIPA PDN connection. If active EPS bearer contexts remain for the UE and the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST request message is accepted, the MME informs the UE via the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that EPS bearer contexts were locally deactivated. For a shared network, the TAIs included in the TAI list can contain different PLMN identities. The MME indicates the selected core network operator PLMN identity to the UE in the GUTI (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.251\u00a0[8B]). If the \"active\" flag is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS bearer contexts. If the \"active\" flag is not included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME may also re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS bearer contexts due to downlink pending data or downlink pending signalling. Upon receiving a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall stop timer T3430, reset the tracking area updating attempt counter, enter state EMM-REGISTERED and set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED. If the message contains a GUTI, the UE shall use this GUTI as new temporary identity for EPS services and shall store the new GUTI. If no GUTI was included by the MME in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the old GUTI shall be used. If the UE receives a new TAI list in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall consider the new TAI list as valid and the old TAI list as invalid; otherwise, the UE shall consider the old TAI list as valid. If the UE had initiated the tracking area updating procedure in EMM-IDLE mode to perform an inter-system change from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode and the nonceUE was included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the UE shall delete the nonceUE upon receipt of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If an EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall deactivate all those EPS bearers contexts locally (without peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the MME) which are active in the UE, but are indicated by the MME as being inactive. If a default EPS bearer context is marked as inactive in the EPS bearer context status IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and this default bearer is not associated with the last PDN in the UE, the UE shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the MME. If only the PDN connection for emergency bearer services remains established, the UE shall consider itself attached for emergency bearer services only. The MME may also include of list of equivalent PLMNs in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. Each entry in the list contains a PLMN code (MCC+MNC). The UE shall store the list as provided by the network, and if there is no PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the UE shall remove from the list any PLMN code that is already in the list of forbidden PLMNs. If there is a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the UE shall remove from the list of equivalent PLMNs any PLMN code present in the list of forbidden PLMNs when the PDN connection for emergency bearer services is released. In addition, the UE shall add to the stored list the PLMN code of the registered PLMN that sent the list. The UE shall replace the stored list on each receipt of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message does not contain a list, then the UE shall delete the stored list. The network may also indicate in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is active. If the UE is attached for emergency bearer services, the network shall indicate in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is not activated. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains: i)\tno indication that ISR is activated, the UE shall set the TIN to \"GUTI\"; ii)\tan indication that ISR is activated, then: -\tif the UE is required to perform routing area updating for IMS voice termination as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13], annex\u00a0P.5, the UE shall set the TIN to \"GUTI\"; -\tif the UE had initiated the tracking area updating procedure due to a change in UE network capability or change in DRX parameters, the UE shall set the TIN to \"GUTI\"; or -\tthe UE shall regard a previously assigned P-TMSI and RAI as valid and registered with the network. If the TIN currently indicates \"P-TMSI\" and the periodic routing area update timer T3312 is running, the UE shall set the TIN to \"RAT-related TMSI\". If the TIN currently indicates \"P-TMSI\" and the periodic routing area update timer T3312 has already expired, the UE shall set the TIN to \"GUTI\". The network informs the UE about the support of specific features, such as IMS voice over PS session, location services (EPC-LCS, CS-LCS) or emergency bearer services, in the EPS network feature support information element. In a UE with IMS voice over PS capability, the IMS voice over PS session indicator and the emergency bearer services indicator shall be provided to the upper layers. The upper layers take the IMS voice over PS session indicator into account as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.221\u00a0[8A], subclause\u00a07.2a and subclause\u00a07.2b, when selecting the access domain for voice sessions or calls. When initiating an emergency call, the upper layers also take the emergency bearer services indicator into account for the access domain selection. When the UE determines via the IMS voice over PS session indicator that the network does not support IMS voice over PS sessions in S1 mode, then the UE shall not locally release any persistent EPS bearer context. When the UE determines via the emergency bearer services indicator that the network does not support emergency bearer services in S1 mode, then the UE shall not locally release any emergency EPS bearer context if there is a radio bearer associated with that context. In a UE with LCS capability, location services indicators (EPC-LCS, CS-LCS) shall be provided to the upper layers. When MO-LR procedure is triggered by the UE's application, those indicators are taken into account as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.171\u00a0[13C]. If the UE has initiated the tracking area updating procedure due to manual CSG selection and receives a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and the UE sent the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message in a CSG cell, the UE shall check if the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the UE has sent the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message are contained in the Allowed CSG list. If not, the UE shall add that CSG ID and associated PLMN identity to the Allowed CSG list and the UE may add the HNB Name (if provided by lower layers) to the Allowed CSG list if the HNB Name is present in neither the Operator CSG list nor the Allowed CSG list. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contained a GUTI, the UE shall return a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message to the MME to acknowledge the received GUTI. Upon receiving a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message, the MME shall stop timer T3450, and shall consider the GUTI sent in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message as valid. For inter-system change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode, if the UE has included an eKSI in the NAS Key Set Identifier IE indicating a current EPS security context in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message by which the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is integrity protected, the MME shall take one of the following actions: -\tif the MME retrieves the current EPS security context as indicated by the eKSI and GUTI sent by the UE, the MME shall integrity check the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message using the current EPS security context and integrity protect the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message using the current EPS security context; or -\tif the MME cannot retrieve the current EPS security context as indicated by the eKSI and GUTI sent by the UE, and if the UE has included a valid GPRS ciphering key sequence number, the MME shall create a new mapped EPS security context as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19], and then perform a security mode control procedure to indicate the use of the new mapped EPS security context to the UE (see subclause\u00a05.4.3.2). NOTE\u00a02:\tThis does not preclude the option for the MME to perform an EPS authentication procedure and create a new native EPS security context. For inter-system change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode, if the UE has not included a valid eKSI in the NAS Key Set Identifier IE and has included a valid GPRS ciphering key sequence number in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall create a new mapped EPS security context as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19], and then perform a security mode control procedure to indicate the use of the new mapped EPS security context to the UE (see subclause\u00a05.4.3.2). NOTE\u00a03:\tThis does not preclude the option for the MME to perform an EPS authentication procedure and create a new native EPS security context. For inter-system change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode in EMM-CONNECTED mode, the MME shall integrity check TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message using the current K'ASME as derived when triggering the handover to E-UTRAN (see subclause\u00a04.4.2.1). The MME shall verify the received UE security capabilities in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. The MME shall then take one of the following actions: -\tif the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST does not contain a valid KSIASME in the Non-current native NAS key set identifier IE, the MME shall remove the non-current native EPS security context, if any, for any GUTI for this UE. The MME shall then integrity protect and cipher the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message using the security context based on K'ASME and take the mapped EPS security context into use; or -\tif the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST contains a valid KSIASME in the Non-current native NAS key set identifier IE, the MME may initiate a security mode control procedure to take the corresponding native EPS security context into use.",

The MME shall not assign a TAI list containing both tracking areas in NB-S1 mode and tracking areas in WB-S1 mode. NOTE\u00a01:\tWhen assigning the TAI list, the MME can take into account the eNodeB's capability of support of CIoT EPS optimization. If the UE has included the UE network capability IE or the MS network capability IE or both in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall store all octets received from the UE, up to the maximum length defined for the respective information element.

In NB-S1 mode, if the tracking area update request is accepted by the network, the MME shall set the EMC BS bit to zero in the EPS network feature support IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message to indicate that support of emergency bearer services in NB-S1 mode is not available. If a UE radio capability information update needed IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall delete the stored UE radio capability information or the UE radio capability ID, if any. If the UE specific DRX parameter was included in the DRX Parameter IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the network shall replace any stored UE specific DRX parameter with the received parameter and use it for the downlink transfer of signalling and user data in WB-S1 mode. In NB-S1 mode, if the DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode IE was included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall provide to the UE the Negotiated DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The MME shall replace any stored UE specific DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode with the negotiated DRX parameter and use it for the downlink transfer of signalling and user data in NB-S1 mode. NOTE\u00a04:\tIn NB-S1 mode, if a DRX parameter was included in the Negotiated DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, then the UE stores and uses the received DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.304\u00a0[21]). If the UE has included the DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, but did not receive a DRX parameter in the Negotiated DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode IE, or if the Negotiated DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode IE was not included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, then the UE uses the cell specific DRX value in NB-S1 mode (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.304\u00a0[21]).If the UE requests \"control plane CIoT EPS optimization\" in the Additional update type IE, indicates support of control plane CIoT EPS optimization in the UE network capability IE and the MME decides to accept the requested CIoT EPS optimization and the tracking area update request, the MME shall indicate \"control plane CIoT EPS optimization supported\" in the EPS network feature support IE. In NB-S1 mode, if the UE requested \"SMS only\" in the Additional update type IE, supports NB-S1 mode only and the MME decides to accept the tracking area update request for EPS services and \"SMS only\", the MME shall indicate \"SMS only\" in the Additional update result IE and shall set the EPS update type IE to \"TA updating\" in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The MME shall include the extended DRX parameters IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message only if the extended DRX parameters IE was included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME supports and accepts the use of eDRX. If: -\tthe UE supports WUS assistance; and -\tthe MME supports and accepts the use of WUS assistance, then the MME shall determine the negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE, store it in the EMM context of the UE, and if the UE is not attaching for emergency bearer services, the MME shall include it in the Negotiated WUS assistance information IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The MME may take into account the UE paging probability information received in the Requested WUS assistance information IE when determining the negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE. NOTE\u00a05:\tBesides the UE paging probability information requested by the UE, the MME can take local configuration or previous statistical information for the UE into account when determining the negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10]). If the UE indicates support for EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the MME supports EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection, the MME shall indicate this in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The UE and the MME shall use the information whether the peer entity supports EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection as specified in the present clause\u00a05 and in clause\u00a06. If an EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall deactivate all those EPS bearer contexts locally (without peer-to-peer signalling between the MME and the UE) which are in ESM state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE or BEARER CONTEXT MODIFY PENDING on the network side, but are indicated by the UE as being in ESM state BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE. If a default EPS bearer context is marked as inactive in the EPS bearer context status IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and this default bearer is not associated with the last remaining PDN connection of the UE in the MME, the MME shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE. If the default bearer is associated with the last remaining PDN connection of the UE in the MME, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the MME shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE. If the default EPS bearer context of a PDN connection established as a user-plane resource of an MA PDU session as specified in clause\u00a05.3 of 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.193\u00a0[61] is deactivated locally and the MA PDU session does not have user plane resources established on non-3GPP access in N1 mode, the network shall perform a local release of the MA PDU session. If the EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST, the MME shall include an EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, indicating which EPS bearer contexts are active in the MME except for the case no EPS bearer context exists on the network side. If the EPS update type IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message indicates \"periodic updating\", and the UE was previously successfully attached for EPS and non-EPS services, subject to operator policies the MME should allocate a TAI list that does not span more than one location area. The MME shall indicate \"combined TA/LA updated\" or \"combined TA/LA updated and ISR activated\" in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, if the following conditions apply: -\tthe EPS update type IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message indicates \"periodic updating\" and the UE was previously successfully attached for EPS and non-EPS services; and -\tlocation area updating for non-EPS services as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.118\u00a0[] is successful. The MME may include T3412 extended value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message only if the UE indicates support of the extended periodic timer T3412 in the MS network feature support IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. The MME shall include the T3324 value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message only if the T3324 value IE was included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME supports and accepts the use of PSM. If the MME supports and accepts the use of PSM, and the UE included the T3412extended value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, then the MME shall take into account the T3412 value requested when providing the T3412 value IE and the T3412 extended value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. NOTE\u00a06:\tBesides the value requested by the MS, the MME can take local configuration or subscription data provided by the HSS into account when selecting a value for T3412 (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10] clause\u00a04.3.17.3). If the MME includes the T3324 value IE indicating a value other than deactivated in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, then the MME shall indicate in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is not activated. Also, during the tracking area updating procedure without the \"active\" flag set, if the MME has deactivated EPS bearer context(s) locally for any reason, the MME shall inform the UE of the deactivated EPS bearer context(s) by including the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. Also, during the tracking area updating procedure with the \"active\" flag set, if the MME has deactivated EPS bearer context(s) associated with control plane only indication locally for any reason, the MME shall inform the UE of the deactivated EPS bearer context(s) by including the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the DCN-ID IE, then the UE shall store the included DCN-ID value together with the PLMN code of the registered PLMN in a DCN-ID list in a non-volatile memory in the ME as specified in annex\u00a0C. If due to regional subscription restrictions or access restrictions the UE is not allowed to access the TA, but it has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the MME may accept the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and deactivate all non-emergency EPS bearer contexts by initiating an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure when the tracking area updating procedure is initiated in EMM-CONNECTED mode. When the tracking area updating procedure is initiated in EMM-IDLE mode, the MME locally deactivates all non-emergency EPS bearer contexts and informs the UE via the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The MME shall not deactivate the emergency EPS bearer contexts. The network shall consider the UE to be attached for emergency bearer services only and shall indicate in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is not activated. If a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received from a UE with a LIPA PDN connection, and if: -\ta GW Transport Layer Address IE value identifying a L-GW is provided by the lower layer together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the P-GW address included in the EPS bearer context of the LIPA PDN Connection is different from the provided GW Transport Layer Address IE value (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[23]); or -\tno GW Transport Layer Address is provided together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message by the lower layer, then the MME locally deactivates all EPS bearer contexts associated with the LIPA PDN connection. Furthermore, the MME takes one of the following actions: -\tif no active EPS bearer contexts remain for the UE, the MME shall not accept the tracking area update request as specified in clause\u00a05.5.3.2.5; -\tif active EPS bearer contexts remain for the UE and the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is accepted, the MME informs the UE via the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that EPS bearer contexts were locally deactivated. If a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received from a UE with a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection, is accepted by the network, the following different cases can be distinguished: 1)\tIf the PDN connection is a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with collocated L-GW and if: -\ta SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address IE value identifying a L-GW is provided by the lower layer together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the P-GW address included in the EPS bearer context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is different from the provided SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address IE value (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[23]); or -\tno SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address is provided together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message by the lower layer, 2)\tIf the PDN connection is a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with stand-alone GW and if: -\ta LHN-ID value is provided by the lower layer together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the LHN-ID stored in the EPS bearer context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is different from the provided LHN-ID value (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[23]); or -\tno LHN-ID value is provided together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message by the lower layer, then the MME takes one of the following actions: -\tif the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is the last remaining PDN connection for the UE, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, then the MME shall upon completion of the tracking area updating procedure detach the UE by using detach type \"re-attach required\" (see clause\u00a05.5.2.3.1); -\tif the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is the last remaining PDN connection for the UE, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, then the MME shall upon completion of the tracking area updating procedure initiate an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure with ESM cause #39 \"reactivation requested\" for the default EPS bearer context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection (see clause 6.4.4.2); and -\tif a PDN connection remains that is not SIPTO at the local network PDN connection, the MME shall upon completion of the tracking area updating procedure initiate an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure with ESM cause\u00a0#39 \"reactivation requested\" for the default EPS bearer context of each SIPTO at the local network PDN connection (see clause\u00a06.4.4.2); For a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with stand-alone GW, the conditions to deactivate ISR are specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10], clause\u00a04.3.5.6. For a shared network, the TAIs included in the TAI list can contain different PLMN identities. The MME indicates the selected core network operator PLMN identity to the UE in the GUTI (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.251\u00a0[8B]). If the \"active\" flag is set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is not used by the MME, the MME shall re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS bearer contexts. If the \"active\" flag is set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is used by the MME, the MME shall re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS bearer contexts associated with PDN connections established without Control plane only indication. If the \"signalling active\" flag is set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is used by the MME, the MME shall not immediately release the NAS signalling connection after the completion of the tracking area updating procedure. If the \"active\" flag is not set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is not used by the MME, the MME may also re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS bearer contexts due to downlink pending data or downlink pending signalling, except for the case when the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message includes the UE request type IE and the Request type is set to \"NAS signalling connection release\". If the \"active\" flag is not set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is used by the MME, the MME may also re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS bearer contexts associated with PDN connections established without Control plane only indication due to downlink pending data or downlink pending signalling, except for the case when the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message includes the UE request type IE and the Request type is set to \"NAS signalling connection release\". If the MME supports NB-S1 mode, non-IP or Ethernet PDN type, inter-system change with 5GS, UAS services or the network wants to enforce the use of DNS over (D)TLS (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.501\u00a0[24]), then the MME shall support the extended protocol configuration options IE. NOTE\u00a07:\tSupport of DNS over (D)TLS is based on the informative requirements as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19] and it is implemented based on the operator requirement. If the MME supports the extended protocol configuration options IE and the UE indicated support of the extended protocol configuration options IE, then the MME shall set the ePCO bit to \"extended protocol configuration options supported\" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE indicates support for restriction on use of enhanced coverage in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the network decides to restrict the use of enhanced coverage for the UE, then the MME shall set the RestrictEC bit to \"Use of enhanced coverage is restricted\" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The MME may indicate the header compression configuration status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message for each established EPS bearer context using control plane CIoT EPS optimisation. If the UE has indicated support for the control plane data back-off timer, and the MME decides to activate the congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane, then the MME shall include the T3448 value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE indicates support for dual connectivity with NR in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME decides to restrict the use of dual connectivity with NR for the UE, then the MME shall set the RestrictDCNR bit to \"Use of dual connectivity with NR is restricted\" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE indicates support for N1 mode in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the MME supports inter-system interworking with 5GS, the MME may set the IWK N26 bit to either: -\t\"interworking without N26 interface not supported\" if the MME supports N26 interface; or -\t\"interworking without N26 interface supported\" if the MME does not support N26 interface in the EPS network feature support IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the MME determines the UE's N1 mode capability for 3GPP access changes from \" N1 mode not supported \" to \" N1 mode supported \" and the network decides to enable the transfer of a PDN connection not supporting interworking to 5GS from S1 mode to N1 mode, the MME may upon completion of the tracking area updating procedure initiate an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure to deactivate the default EPS bearer context of the PDN connection by including ESM cause #39 \"reactivation requested\" in the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message (see clause 6.4.4.2). If due to operator policies unsecured redirection to a GERAN cell is not allowed in the current PLMN, the MME shall set the redir-policy bit to \"Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed\" in the Network policy IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE has indicated support for service gap control, a service gap time value is available in the EMM context, the MME may include the T3447 value IE set to the service gap time value in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the network supports signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts and the UE indicated support of signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, then the MME shall set the 15 bearers bit to \"Signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts supported\" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE indicates support of the NAS signalling connection release in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the network decides to accept the NAS signalling connection release, then the MME shall set the NAS signalling connection release bit to \"NAS signalling connection release supported\" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE indicates support of the paging indication for voice services in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the network decides to accept the paging indication for voice services, then the MME shall set the paging indication for voice services bit to \"paging indication for voice services supported\" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE receives the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message with the paging indication for voice services bit set to \"paging indication for voice services supported\", the UE NAS layer informs the lower layers that paging indication for voice services is supported. Otherwise, the UE NAS layer informs the lower layers that paging indication for voice services is not supported. If the UE indicates support of the reject paging request in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the network decides to accept the reject paging request, then the MME shall set the reject paging request bit to \"reject paging request supported\" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE indicates support of the paging restriction in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME sets: -\tthe reject paging request bit to \"reject paging request supported\"; -\tthe NAS signalling connection release bit to \"NAS signalling connection release supported\"; or -\tboth of them; in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and the network decides to accept the paging restriction, then the MME shall set the paging restriction bit to \"paging restriction supported\" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE indicates support of the paging timing collision control in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the network decides to accept the paging timing collision control, then the MME shall set the paging timing collision control bit to \"paging timing collision control supported\" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE requests ciphering keys for ciphered broadcast assistance data in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the MME has valid ciphering key data applicable to the UE's subscription, then the MME shall include the ciphering key data in the Ciphering key data IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the MUSIM UE does not include the Paging restriction IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall delete any stored paging restriction for the UE and stop restricting paging. If the MUSIM UE has included a Requested IMSI offset IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with the EPS update type IE not indicating \"periodic updating\" and if the MME supports paging timing collision control, the MME shall include the Negotiated IMSI offset IE and assign a new GUTI in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and the MME shall set the IMSI offset value to: -\tA value that is different than what the UE has provided, if the MME has a different value; or -\tA value that is same as what the UE has provided, if the MME does not have a different value; and the MME shall calculate an alternative IMSI value using the IMSI offset value and store it in the UE context as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10]. The alternative IMSI value is used for deriving the paging occasion as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.304\u00a0[21]. If the MUSIM UE has not included a Requested IMSI offset IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with the EPS update type IE not indicating \"periodic updating\" and the MME has stored an alternative IMSI value for that UE, the MME shall erase the alternative IMSI value and assign a new GUTI in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the MUSIM UE requests the release of the NAS signalling connection, by setting Request type to \"NAS signalling connection release\" in the UE request type IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME supports the NAS signalling connection release, the MME shall initiate the release of the NAS signalling connection after the completion of the tracking area updating procedure. If the UE requests restriction of paging by including the Paging restriction IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the MME supports the paging restriction, the MME: -\tif accepts the paging restriction, shall include the EPS additional request result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and set the Paging restriction decision to \"paging restriction is accepted\". The MME shall store the paging restriction of the UE and enforce these restrictions in the paging procedure as described in clause\u00a05.6.2; or -\tif rejects the paging restriction, shall include the EPS additional request result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and set the Paging restriction decision to \"paging restriction is rejected\", and shall discard the received paging restriction. The MME shall delete any stored paging restriction for the UE and stop restricting paging. Upon receiving a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall stop timer T3430, reset the service request attempt counter, tracking area updating attempt counter, enter state EMM-REGISTERED and set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED. If the message contains a GUTI, the UE shall use this GUTI as new temporary identity for EPS services and shall store the new GUTI. If no GUTI was included by the MME in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the old GUTI shall be used. If the UE receives a new TAI list in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall consider the new TAI list as valid and the old TAI list as invalid; otherwise, the UE shall consider the old TAI list as valid. If the UE receives the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message from a PLMN for which a PLMN-specific attempt counter or PLMN-specific PS-attempt counter is maintained (see clause\u00a05.3.7b), then the UE shall reset these counters. If the UE maintains a counter for \"SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services\", then the UE shall reset this counter. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the T3412 extended value IE, then the UE shall use the T3412 extended value IE as periodic tracking area update timer (T3412). If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT contains T3412 value IE, but not T3412 extended value IE, then the UE shall use value in T3412 value IE as periodic tracking area update timer (T3412). If neither T3412 value IE nor T3412 extended value IE is included, the UE shall use the value currently stored, e.g. from a prior ATTACH ACCEPT or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the T3324 value IE, then the UE shall use the timer value for T3324 as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13], clause\u00a04.7.2.8. If the UE had initiated the tracking area updating procedure in EMM-IDLE mode to perform an inter-system change from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode and the nonceUE was included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the UE shall delete the nonceUE upon receipt of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If an EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall deactivate all those EPS bearers contexts locally (without peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the MME) which are active in the UE, but are indicated by the MME as being inactive. If a default EPS bearer context is marked as inactive in the EPS bearer context status IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and this default bearer is not associated with the last remaining PDN connection in the UE, the UE shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the MME. If only the PDN connection for emergency bearer services remains established, the UE shall consider itself attached for emergency bearer services only. If the default bearer is associated with the last remaining PDN connection of the UE in the MME, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the UE shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE. If the default EPS bearer context of a PDN connection established as a user-plane resource of an MA PDU session as specified in clause\u00a05.3 of 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.193\u00a0[61] is deactivated locally and the MA PDU session does not have user plane resources established on non-3GPP access in N1 mode, the UE shall perform a local release of the MA PDU session. If an EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE may choose to ignore all those EPS bearers which are indicated by the MME as being active but are inactive at the UE. If a Negotiated IMSI offset IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the MUSIM UE shall forward the IMSI offset value to lower layers. If a Negotiated IMSI offset IE is not included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and the EPS update type IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message does not indicate \"periodic updating\", the MUSIM UE shall indicate to lower layers to erase any IMSI offset value, if available. The MME may also include a list of equivalent PLMNs in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. Each entry in the list contains a PLMN code (MCC+MNC). The UE shall store the list as provided by the network, and if there is no PDN connection for emergency bearer services or PDN connection for RLOS established, the UE shall remove from the list any PLMN code that is already in the list of \"forbidden PLMNs\" or in the list of \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\". If the UE is not attached for emergency bearer services and there is a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the UE shall remove from the list of equivalent PLMNs any PLMN code present in the list of forbidden PLMNs or in the list of \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" when the PDN connection for emergency bearer services is released. In addition, the UE shall add to the stored list the PLMN code of the registered PLMN that sent the list. The UE shall replace the stored list on each receipt of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message does not contain a list, then the UE shall delete the stored list. If the UE is neither attached for emergency bearer services nor attached for access to RLOS, and if the PLMN identity of the registered PLMN is a member of the list of \"forbidden PLMNs\" or the list of \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\", any such PLMN identity shall be deleted from the corresponding list(s). The network may also indicate in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is active. If the UE is attached for emergency bearer services, the network shall indicate in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is not activated. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains: i)\tno indication that ISR is activated, the UE shall set the TIN to \"GUTI\" and shall stop the periodic routing area update timer T3312 or T3323, if running; ii)\tan indication that ISR is activated, then: -\tif the UE is required to perform routing area updating for IMS voice termination as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13], annex\u00a0P.5, the UE shall set the TIN to \"GUTI\" and shall stop the periodic routing area update timer T3312 or T3323, if running; -\tif the UE had initiated the tracking area updating procedure due to a change in UE network capability or change in DRX parameters, the UE shall set the TIN to \"GUTI\" and shall stop the periodic routing area update timer T3312 or T3323, if running; -\tif the UE had initiated the tracking area updating procedure due to a change in the UE's usage setting or the voice domain preference for E-UTRAN, the UE shall set the TIN to \"GUTI\" and shall stop the periodic routing area update timer T3312 or T3323, if running; or -\tthe UE shall regard a previously assigned P-TMSI and RAI as valid and registered with the network. If the TIN currently indicates \"P-TMSI\" and the periodic routing area update timer T3312 is running or is deactivated, the UE shall set the TIN to \"RAT-related TMSI\". If the TIN currently indicates \"P-TMSI\" and the periodic routing area update timer T3312 has already expired, the UE shall set the TIN to \"GUTI\". The network informs the UE about the support of specific features, such as IMS voice over PS session, location services (EPC-LCS, CS-LCS), emergency bearer services, or CIoT EPS optimizations, in the EPS network feature support information element. In a UE with IMS voice over PS capability, the IMS voice over PS session indicator and the emergency bearer services indicator shall be provided to the upper layers. The upper layers take the IMS voice over PS session indicator into account as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.221\u00a0[8A], clause\u00a07.2a and clause\u00a07.2b, when selecting the access domain for voice sessions or calls. When initiating an emergency call, the upper layers also take both the IMS voice over PS session indicator and the emergency bearer services indicator into account for the access domain selection. When the UE determines via the IMS voice over PS session indicator that the network does not support IMS voice over PS sessions in S1 mode, then the UE shall not locally release any persistent EPS bearer context. When the UE determines via the emergency bearer services indicator that the network does not support emergency bearer services in S1 mode, then the UE shall not locally release any emergency EPS bearer context if there is a radio bearer associated with that context. In a UE with LCS capability, location services indicators (EPC-LCS, CS-LCS) shall be provided to the upper layers. When MO-LR procedure is triggered by the UE's application, those indicators are taken into account as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.171\u00a0[13C]. If the MME received the list of TAIs from the satellite E-UTRAN as described in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10], and determines that, by UE subscription and operator's preferences any but not all TAIs in the received list of TAIs is forbidden for roaming or for regional provision of service, the MME shall include the TAI(s) in: a)\tthe Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" IE; b)\tthe Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\" IE; or c)\tboth, in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. NOTE\u00a08:\tVoid If the RestrictDCNR bit is set to \"Use of dual connectivity with NR is restricted\" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall provide the indication that dual connectivity with NR is restricted to the upper layers. The UE supporting N1 mode shall operate in the mode for inter-system interworking with 5GS as follows: -\tif the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to \"interworking without N26 interface not supported\", the UE shall operate in single-registration mode; -\tif the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to \"interworking without N26 interface supported\" and the UE supports dual-registration mode, the UE may operate in dual-registration mode; or NOTE\u00a09:\tThe registration mode used by the UE is implementation dependent. -\tif the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to \"interworking without N26 interface supported\" and the UE only supports single-registration mode, the UE shall operate in single-registration mode. The UE shall treat the interworking without N26 interface indicator as valid in the entire PLMN and equivalent PLMNs. The interworking procedures required for coordination between 5GMM and EMM without N26 interface are specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54]. If the redir-policy bit is set to \"Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed\" in the Network policy IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall set the network policy on unsecured redirection to GERAN for the current PLMN to \"Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed\" and indicate to the lower layers that unsecured redirection to a GERAN cell is not allowed. If the redir-policy bit is set to \"Unsecured redirection to GERAN allowed\" or if the Network policy IE is not included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall set the network policy on unsecured redirection to GERAN for the current PLMN to \"Unsecured redirection to GERAN allowed\" and indicate to the lower layers that unsecured redirection to a GERAN cell is allowed. The UE shall set the network policy on unsecured redirection to GERAN to \"Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed\" and indicate this to the lower layers when any of the following events occurs: -\tthe UE initiates an EPS attach or tracking area updating procedure in a PLMN different from the PLMN where the UE performed the last successful EPS attach or tracking area updating procedure; -\tthe UE is switched on; or -\tthe UICC containing the USIM is removed. If the UE has initiated the tracking area updating procedure due to manual CSG selection and receives a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and the UE sent the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message in a CSG cell, the UE shall check if the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the UE has sent the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message are contained in the Allowed CSG list. If not, the UE shall add that CSG ID and associated PLMN identity to the Allowed CSG list and the UE may add the HNB Name (if provided by lower layers) to the Allowed CSG list if the HNB Name is present in neither the Operator CSG list nor the Allowed CSG list. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contained a GUTI, the UE shall return a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message to the MME to acknowledge the received GUTI or the received Negotiated IMSI offset IE. If the UE has a negotiated IMSI offset value stored at the lower layers and the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message does not contain the Negotiated IMSI offset IE, the UE shall return a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message to the MME, and the MME shall erase the stored alternative IMSI value for the UE upon receiving the TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message. If the UE which was previously successfully attached for EPS and non-EPS services receives the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message with EPS update result IE indicating \"combined TA/LA updated\" or \"combined TA/LA updated and ISR activated\" as the response of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with EPS update type IE indicating \"periodic updating\", the UE shall behave as follows: -\tIf the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains an IMSI, the UE is not allocated any TMSI, and shall delete any old TMSI accordingly. -\tIf the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains a TMSI, the UE shall use this TMSI as new temporary identity. The UE shall delete its old TMSI and shall store the new TMSI. In this case, a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message is returned to the network to confirm the received TMSI. -\tIf neither a TMSI nor an IMSI has been included by the network in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the old TMSI, if any is available, shall be kept. If the header compression configuration status is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall stop using header compression and decompression for those EPS bearers using Control plane CIoT EPS optimisation for which the MME indicated that the header compression configuration is not used. If the T3448 value IE is present in the received TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall: -\tstop timer T3448 if it is running; and -\tstart timer T3448 with the value provided in the T3448 value IE. If the UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization, the T3448 value IE is present in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and the value indicates that this timer is either zero or deactivated, the UE shall consider this case as an abnormal case and proceed as if the T3448 value IE is not present. If the UE in EMM-IDLE mode initiated the tracking area updating procedure and the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message does not include the T3448 value IE and if timer T3448 is running, then the UE shall stop timer T3448. If the UE has indicated \"service gap control supported\" in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and: -\tthe TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the T3447 value IE, then the UE shall store the new T3447 value, erase any previous stored T3447 value if exists and use the new T3447 value with the T3447 timer next time it is started; or -\tthe TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message does not contain the T3447 value IE, then the UE shall erase any previous stored T3447 value if exists and stop the T3447 timer if running. Upon receiving a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message, the MME shall stop timer T3450 and change to state EMM-REGISTERED. The GUTI, the Negotiated IMSI offset, or both, if sent in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, shall be considered as valid. NOTE\u00a010:\tUpon receiving a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message, if a new TMSI was included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the MME sends an SGsAP-TMSI-REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.118\u00a0[16A]. For inter-system change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode, if the UE has included an eKSI in the NAS Key Set Identifier IE indicating a current EPS security context in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message by which the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is integrity protected, the MME shall take one of the following actions: -\tif the MME retrieves the current EPS security context as indicated by the eKSI and GUTI sent by the UE, the MME shall integrity check the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message using the current EPS security context and integrity protect the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message using the current EPS security context; -\tif the MME cannot retrieve the current EPS security context as indicated by the eKSI and GUTI sent by the UE, and if the UE has included a valid GPRS ciphering key sequence number, the MME shall create a new mapped EPS security context as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19], and then perform a security mode control procedure to indicate the use of the new mapped EPS security context to the UE (see clause\u00a05.4.3.2); or -\tif the UE has not included an Additional GUTI IE, the MME may treat the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message as in the previous item, i.e. as if it cannot retrieve the current EPS security context. NOTE\u00a011:\tThe handling described above at failure to retrieve the current EPS security context or if no Additional GUTI IE was provided does not preclude the option for the MME to perform an EPS authentication procedure and create a new native EPS security context. For inter-system change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode, if the UE has not included a valid eKSI in the NAS Key Set Identifier IE and has included a valid GPRS ciphering key sequence number in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall create a new mapped EPS security context as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19], and then perform a security mode control procedure to indicate the use of the new mapped EPS security context to the UE (see clause\u00a05.4.3.2). NOTE\u00a012:\tThis does not preclude the option for the MME to perform an EPS authentication procedure and create a new native EPS security context. For inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode, if the UE has included an eKSI in the NAS Key Set Identifier IE indicating a 5G NAS security context in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message by which the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is integrity protected, the MME shall take actions as specified in clause\u00a04.4.2.3. For inter-system change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode in EMM-CONNECTED mode, the MME shall integrity check TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message using the current K'ASME as derived when triggering the handover to E-UTRAN (see clause\u00a04.4.2.2). The MME shall verify the received UE security capabilities in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. The MME shall then take one of the following actions: -\tif the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST does not contain a valid KSIASME in the Non-current native NAS key set identifier IE, the MME shall remove the non-current native EPS security context, if any, for any GUTI for this UE. The MME shall then integrity protect and cipher the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message using the security context based on K'ASME and take the mapped EPS security context into use; or -\tif the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST contains a valid KSIASME in the Non-current native NAS key set identifier IE, the MME may initiate a security mode control procedure to take the corresponding native EPS security context into use. For inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-CONNECTED mode, the MME shall integrity check TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message using the current K'ASME as derived when triggering the handover to E-UTRAN (see clause\u00a04.4.2.2). The MME shall verify the received UE security capabilities in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. The MME shall then take one of the following actions: -\tif the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST does not contain a valid KSIASME in the Non-current native NAS key set identifier IE, the MME shall remove the non-current native EPS security context, if any, for any GUTI for this UE. The MME shall then integrity protect and cipher the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message using the security context based on K'ASME and take the mapped EPS security context into use; or -\tif the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST contains a valid KSIASME in the Non-current native NAS key set identifier IE, the MME may initiate a security mode control procedure to take the corresponding native EPS security context into use. In WB-S1 mode, if the UE has set the RACS bit to \"RACS supported\" in the UE network capability IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME may include a UE radio capability ID IE or a UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. In this case the MME shall enter state EMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in clause\u00a05.4.1. In WB-S1 mode, if the UE has set the RACS bit to \"RACS supported\" in the UE network capability IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message includes: -\ta UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE set to \"Network-assigned UE radio capability IDs deletion requested\", the UE shall: a)\tdelete any network-assigned UE radio capability IDs associated with the registered PLMN stored at the UE; b)\tsend a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message to the network to acknowledge the received UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE; and c)\tafter the completion of the ongoing tracking area updating procedure, initiate a tracking area updating procedure as specified in clause\u00a05.5.3 over the existing NAS signalling connection except if there is a pending service request procedure as response to paging for CS fallback; and -\ta UE radio capability ID IE, the UE shall: a)\tstore the UE radio capability ID as specified in annex\u00a0C; and b)\tsend a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message to the network to acknowledge the received UE radio capability ID IE. If the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" IE in the TRACKING ARE UPDATE ACCEPT message and the TAI(s) included in the IE is not part of the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\", the UE shall store the TAI(s) included in the IE into the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" and remove the TAI(s) from the stored TAI list if present. If the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\" IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and the TAI(s) included in the IE is not part of the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\", the UE shall store the TAI(s) included in the IE into the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\" and remove the TAI(s) from the stored TAI list if present. 5.5.3.2.4A\tTracking area updating successful for EPS services and not accepted for SMS services Apart from the actions on the tracking area updating attempt counter, the description for tracking area update for EPS services as specified in clause\u00a05.5.3.2.4 shall be followed. In addition, the following description for tracking area updating for SMS services applies. In NB-S1 mode, if the UE requested \"SMS only\" in the Additional update type IE and supports NB-S1 mode only, the MME decides to accept the tracking area update request for EPS services only and: -\tthe location update for non-EPS services is not accepted by the VLR as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.118\u00a0[16A]; or -\tthe MME decides to not accept the tracking area update request for \"SMS only\", the MME shall set the EPS update result IE to \"EPS only\", shall not indicate \"SMS only\" in the Additional update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and shall include an appropriate SMS services status value. The UE receiving the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message takes one of the following actions depending on the value included in the SMS services status IE: \"SMS services not available\" The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running, shall reset the tracking area updating attempt counter, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The USIM shall be considered as invalid for SMS services until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described in clause\u00a05.3.7a. \"SMS services not available in this PLMN\" The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running, shall reset the tracking area updating attempt counter, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The UE may provide a notification to the user or the upper layers that the SMS services are not available. The UE shall not attempt normal attach or tracking area updating procedures indicating \"SMS only\" with current PLMN until switching off the UE or the UICC containing the USIM is removed. Additionally, the UE may perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[6]. \"Network failure\" The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running. The tracking area updating attempt counter shall be incremented, unless it was already set to 5. If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5: -\tthe UE shall start timer T3411, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer T3411 expires the normal tracking area updating procedure for EPS services and \"SMS only\" or the combined tracking area updating procedure for EPS services and \"SMS only\" is triggered. If the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5: -\tthe UE shall start timer T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer T3402 expires the normal tracking area updating procedure for EPS services and \"SMS only\" or the combined tracking area updating procedure for EPS services and \"SMS only\" is triggered. \"Congestion\" The UE shall stop the timer T3430 if still running. The tracking area updating attempt counter shall be set to\u00a05. The UE shall start the timer T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED, and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer T3402 expires the normal tracking area updating procedure for EPS services and \"SMS only\" or the combined tracking area updating procedure for EPS services and \"SMS only\" is triggered. Other values are considered as abnormal cases. The tracking area updating procedure shall be considered as failed for SMS services. The behaviour of the UE in those cases is specified in clause\u00a05.5.3.2.6A.",
    "text": "5.5.3.2.4A\tTracking area updating successful for EPS services and not accepted for SMS services\t198 If the tracking area update request has been accepted by the network, the MME shall send a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message to the UE. If the MME assigns a new GUTI for the UE, a GUTI shall be included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the MME includes the GUTI IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the MME shall start timer T3450 and enter state EMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in clause\u00a05.4.1. The MME may include a new TAI list for the UE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The MME shall not assign a TAI list containing both tracking areas in NB-S1 mode and tracking areas in WB-S1 mode. NOTE\u00a01:\tWhen assigning the TAI list, the MME can take into account the eNodeB's capability of support of CIoT EPS optimization. If the UE has included the UE network capability IE or the MS network capability IE or both in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall store all octets received from the UE, up to the maximum length defined for the respective information element. NOTE\u00a02:\tThis information is forwarded to the new MME during inter-MME handover or to the new SGSN during inter-system handover to A/Gb mode or Iu mode. NOTE\u00a03:\tFor further details concerning the handling of the MS network capability and UE network capability in the MME see also 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10]. In NB-S1 mode, if the tracking area update request is accepted by the network, the MME shall set the EMC BS bit to zero in the EPS network feature support IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message to indicate that support of emergency bearer services in NB-S1 mode is not available. If a UE radio capability information update needed IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall delete the stored UE radio capability information or the UE radio capability ID, if any. If the UE specific DRX parameter was included in the DRX Parameter IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the network shall replace any stored UE specific DRX parameter with the received parameter and use it for the downlink transfer of signalling and user data in WB-S1 mode. In NB-S1 mode, if the DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode IE was included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall provide to the UE the Negotiated DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The MME shall replace any stored UE specific DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode with the negotiated DRX parameter and use it for the downlink transfer of signalling and user data in NB-S1 mode. NOTE\u00a04:\tIn NB-S1 mode, if a DRX parameter was included in the Negotiated DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, then the UE stores and uses the received DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.304\u00a0[21]). If the UE has included the DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, but did not receive a DRX parameter in the Negotiated DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode IE, or if the Negotiated DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode IE was not included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, then the UE uses the cell specific DRX value in NB-S1 mode (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.304\u00a0[21]).If the UE requests \"control plane CIoT EPS optimization\" in the Additional update type IE, indicates support of control plane CIoT EPS optimization in the UE network capability IE and the MME decides to accept the requested CIoT EPS optimization and the tracking area update request, the MME shall indicate \"control plane CIoT EPS optimization supported\" in the EPS network feature support IE. In NB-S1 mode, if the UE requested \"SMS only\" in the Additional update type IE, supports NB-S1 mode only and the MME decides to accept the tracking area update request for EPS services and \"SMS only\", the MME shall indicate \"SMS only\" in the Additional update result IE and shall set the EPS update type IE to \"TA updating\" in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The MME shall include the extended DRX parameters IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message only if the extended DRX parameters IE was included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME supports and accepts the use of eDRX. If: -\tthe UE supports WUS assistance; and -\tthe MME supports and accepts the use of WUS assistance, then the MME shall determine the negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE, store it in the EMM context of the UE, and if the UE is not attaching for emergency bearer services, the MME shall include it in the Negotiated WUS assistance information IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The MME may take into account the UE paging probability information received in the Requested WUS assistance information IE when determining the negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE. NOTE\u00a05:\tBesides the UE paging probability information requested by the UE, the MME can take local configuration or previous statistical information for the UE into account when determining the negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10]). If the UE indicates support for EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the MME supports EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection, the MME shall indicate this in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The UE and the MME shall use the information whether the peer entity supports EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection as specified in the present clause\u00a05 and in clause\u00a06. If an EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall deactivate all those EPS bearer contexts locally (without peer-to-peer signalling between the MME and the UE) which are in ESM state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE or BEARER CONTEXT MODIFY PENDING on the network side, but are indicated by the UE as being in ESM state BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE. If a default EPS bearer context is marked as inactive in the EPS bearer context status IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and this default bearer is not associated with the last remaining PDN connection of the UE in the MME, the MME shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE. If the default bearer is associated with the last remaining PDN connection of the UE in the MME, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the MME shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE. If the default EPS bearer context of a PDN connection established as a user-plane resource of an MA PDU session as specified in clause\u00a05.3 of 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.193\u00a0[61] is deactivated locally and the MA PDU session does not have user plane resources established on non-3GPP access in N1 mode, the network shall perform a local release of the MA PDU session. If the EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST, the MME shall include an EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, indicating which EPS bearer contexts are active in the MME except for the case no EPS bearer context exists on the network side. If the EPS update type IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message indicates \"periodic updating\", and the UE was previously successfully attached for EPS and non-EPS services, subject to operator policies the MME should allocate a TAI list that does not span more than one location area. The MME shall indicate \"combined TA/LA updated\" or \"combined TA/LA updated and ISR activated\" in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, if the following conditions apply: -\tthe EPS update type IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message indicates \"periodic updating\" and the UE was previously successfully attached for EPS and non-EPS services; and -\tlocation area updating for non-EPS services as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.118\u00a0[] is successful. The MME may include T3412 extended value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message only if the UE indicates support of the extended periodic timer T3412 in the MS network feature support IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. The MME shall include the T3324 value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message only if the T3324 value IE was included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME supports and accepts the use of PSM. If the MME supports and accepts the use of PSM, and the UE included the T3412extended value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, then the MME shall take into account the T3412 value requested when providing the T3412 value IE and the T3412 extended value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. NOTE\u00a06:\tBesides the value requested by the MS, the MME can take local configuration or subscription data provided by the HSS into account when selecting a value for T3412 (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10] clause\u00a04.3.17.3). If the MME includes the T3324 value IE indicating a value other than deactivated in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, then the MME shall indicate in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is not activated. Also, during the tracking area updating procedure without the \"active\" flag set, if the MME has deactivated EPS bearer context(s) locally for any reason, the MME shall inform the UE of the deactivated EPS bearer context(s) by including the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. Also, during the tracking area updating procedure with the \"active\" flag set, if the MME has deactivated EPS bearer context(s) associated with control plane only indication locally for any reason, the MME shall inform the UE of the deactivated EPS bearer context(s) by including the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the DCN-ID IE, then the UE shall store the included DCN-ID value together with the PLMN code of the registered PLMN in a DCN-ID list in a non-volatile memory in the ME as specified in annex\u00a0C. If due to regional subscription restrictions or access restrictions the UE is not allowed to access the TA, but it has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the MME may accept the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and deactivate all non-emergency EPS bearer contexts by initiating an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure when the tracking area updating procedure is initiated in EMM-CONNECTED mode. When the tracking area updating procedure is initiated in EMM-IDLE mode, the MME locally deactivates all non-emergency EPS bearer contexts and informs the UE via the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The MME shall not deactivate the emergency EPS bearer contexts. The network shall consider the UE to be attached for emergency bearer services only and shall indicate in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is not activated. If a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received from a UE with a LIPA PDN connection, and if: -\ta GW Transport Layer Address IE value identifying a L-GW is provided by the lower layer together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the P-GW address included in the EPS bearer context of the LIPA PDN Connection is different from the provided GW Transport Layer Address IE value (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[23]); or -\tno GW Transport Layer Address is provided together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message by the lower layer, then the MME locally deactivates all EPS bearer contexts associated with the LIPA PDN connection. Furthermore, the MME takes one of the following actions: -\tif no active EPS bearer contexts remain for the UE, the MME shall not accept the tracking area update request as specified in clause\u00a05.5.3.2.5; -\tif active EPS bearer contexts remain for the UE and the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is accepted, the MME informs the UE via the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that EPS bearer contexts were locally deactivated. If a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received from a UE with a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection, is accepted by the network, the following different cases can be distinguished: 1)\tIf the PDN connection is a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with collocated L-GW and if: -\ta SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address IE value identifying a L-GW is provided by the lower layer together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the P-GW address included in the EPS bearer context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is different from the provided SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address IE value (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[23]); or -\tno SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address is provided together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message by the lower layer, 2)\tIf the PDN connection is a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with stand-alone GW and if: -\ta LHN-ID value is provided by the lower layer together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the LHN-ID stored in the EPS bearer context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is different from the provided LHN-ID value (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[23]); or -\tno LHN-ID value is provided together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message by the lower layer, then the MME takes one of the following actions: -\tif the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is the last remaining PDN connection for the UE, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, then the MME shall upon completion of the tracking area updating procedure detach the UE by using detach type \"re-attach required\" (see clause\u00a05.5.2.3.1); -\tif the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is the last remaining PDN connection for the UE, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, then the MME shall upon completion of the tracking area updating procedure initiate an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure with ESM cause #39 \"reactivation requested\" for the default EPS bearer context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection (see clause 6.4.4.2); and -\tif a PDN connection remains that is not SIPTO at the local network PDN connection, the MME shall upon completion of the tracking area updating procedure initiate an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure with ESM cause\u00a0#39 \"reactivation requested\" for the default EPS bearer context of each SIPTO at the local network PDN connection (see clause\u00a06.4.4.2); For a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with stand-alone GW, the conditions to deactivate ISR are specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10], clause\u00a04.3.5.6. For a shared network, the TAIs included in the TAI list can contain different PLMN identities. The MME indicates the selected core network operator PLMN identity to the UE in the GUTI (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.251\u00a0[8B]). If the \"active\" flag is set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is not used by the MME, the MME shall re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS bearer contexts. If the \"active\" flag is set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is used by the MME, the MME shall re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS bearer contexts associated with PDN connections established without Control plane only indication. If the \"signalling active\" flag is set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is used by the MME, the MME shall not immediately release the NAS signalling connection after the completion of the tracking area updating procedure. If the \"active\" flag is not set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is not used by the MME, the MME may also re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS bearer contexts due to downlink pending data or downlink pending signalling, except for the case when the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message includes the UE request type IE and the Request type is set to \"NAS signalling connection release\". If the \"active\" flag is not set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is used by the MME, the MME may also re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS bearer contexts associated with PDN connections established without Control plane only indication due to downlink pending data or downlink pending signalling, except for the case when the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message includes the UE request type IE and the Request type is set to \"NAS signalling connection release\". If the MME supports NB-S1 mode, non-IP or Ethernet PDN type, inter-system change with 5GS, UAS services or the network wants to enforce the use of DNS over (D)TLS (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.501\u00a0[24]), then the MME shall support the extended protocol configuration options IE. NOTE\u00a07:\tSupport of DNS over (D)TLS is based on the informative requirements as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19] and it is implemented based on the operator requirement. If the MME supports the extended protocol configuration options IE and the UE indicated support of the extended protocol configuration options IE, then the MME shall set the ePCO bit to \"extended protocol configuration options supported\" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE indicates support for restriction on use of enhanced coverage in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the network decides to restrict the use of enhanced coverage for the UE, then the MME shall set the RestrictEC bit to \"Use of enhanced coverage is restricted\" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The MME may indicate the header compression configuration status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message for each established EPS bearer context using control plane CIoT EPS optimisation. If the UE has indicated support for the control plane data back-off timer, and the MME decides to activate the congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane, then the MME shall include the T3448 value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE indicates support for dual connectivity with NR in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME decides to restrict the use of dual connectivity with NR for the UE, then the MME shall set the RestrictDCNR bit to \"Use of dual connectivity with NR is restricted\" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE indicates support for N1 mode in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the MME supports inter-system interworking with 5GS, the MME may set the IWK N26 bit to either: -\t\"interworking without N26 interface not supported\" if the MME supports N26 interface; or -\t\"interworking without N26 interface supported\" if the MME does not support N26 interface in the EPS network feature support IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the MME determines the UE's N1 mode capability for 3GPP access changes from \" N1 mode not supported \" to \" N1 mode supported \" and the network decides to enable the transfer of a PDN connection not supporting interworking to 5GS from S1 mode to N1 mode, the MME may upon completion of the tracking area updating procedure initiate an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure to deactivate the default EPS bearer context of the PDN connection by including ESM cause #39 \"reactivation requested\" in the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message (see clause 6.4.4.2). If due to operator policies unsecured redirection to a GERAN cell is not allowed in the current PLMN, the MME shall set the redir-policy bit to \"Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed\" in the Network policy IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE has indicated support for service gap control, a service gap time value is available in the EMM context, the MME may include the T3447 value IE set to the service gap time value in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the network supports signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts and the UE indicated support of signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, then the MME shall set the 15 bearers bit to \"Signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts supported\" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE indicates support of the NAS signalling connection release in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the network decides to accept the NAS signalling connection release, then the MME shall set the NAS signalling connection release bit to \"NAS signalling connection release supported\" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE indicates support of the paging indication for voice services in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the network decides to accept the paging indication for voice services, then the MME shall set the paging indication for voice services bit to \"paging indication for voice services supported\" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE receives the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message with the paging indication for voice services bit set to \"paging indication for voice services supported\", the UE NAS layer informs the lower layers that paging indication for voice services is supported. Otherwise, the UE NAS layer informs the lower layers that paging indication for voice services is not supported. If the UE indicates support of the reject paging request in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the network decides to accept the reject paging request, then the MME shall set the reject paging request bit to \"reject paging request supported\" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE indicates support of the paging restriction in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME sets: -\tthe reject paging request bit to \"reject paging request supported\"; -\tthe NAS signalling connection release bit to \"NAS signalling connection release supported\"; or -\tboth of them; in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and the network decides to accept the paging restriction, then the MME shall set the paging restriction bit to \"paging restriction supported\" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE indicates support of the paging timing collision control in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the network decides to accept the paging timing collision control, then the MME shall set the paging timing collision control bit to \"paging timing collision control supported\" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE requests ciphering keys for ciphered broadcast assistance data in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the MME has valid ciphering key data applicable to the UE's subscription, then the MME shall include the ciphering key data in the Ciphering key data IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the MUSIM UE does not include the Paging restriction IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall delete any stored paging restriction for the UE and stop restricting paging. If the MUSIM UE has included a Requested IMSI offset IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with the EPS update type IE not indicating \"periodic updating\" and if the MME supports paging timing collision control, the MME shall include the Negotiated IMSI offset IE and assign a new GUTI in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and the MME shall set the IMSI offset value to: -\tA value that is different than what the UE has provided, if the MME has a different value; or -\tA value that is same as what the UE has provided, if the MME does not have a different value; and the MME shall calculate an alternative IMSI value using the IMSI offset value and store it in the UE context as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10]. The alternative IMSI value is used for deriving the paging occasion as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.304\u00a0[21]. If the MUSIM UE has not included a Requested IMSI offset IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with the EPS update type IE not indicating \"periodic updating\" and the MME has stored an alternative IMSI value for that UE, the MME shall erase the alternative IMSI value and assign a new GUTI in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the MUSIM UE requests the release of the NAS signalling connection, by setting Request type to \"NAS signalling connection release\" in the UE request type IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME supports the NAS signalling connection release, the MME shall initiate the release of the NAS signalling connection after the completion of the tracking area updating procedure. If the UE requests restriction of paging by including the Paging restriction IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the MME supports the paging restriction, the MME: -\tif accepts the paging restriction, shall include the EPS additional request result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and set the Paging restriction decision to \"paging restriction is accepted\". The MME shall store the paging restriction of the UE and enforce these restrictions in the paging procedure as described in clause\u00a05.6.2; or -\tif rejects the paging restriction, shall include the EPS additional request result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and set the Paging restriction decision to \"paging restriction is rejected\", and shall discard the received paging restriction. The MME shall delete any stored paging restriction for the UE and stop restricting paging. Upon receiving a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall stop timer T3430, reset the service request attempt counter, tracking area updating attempt counter, enter state EMM-REGISTERED and set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED. If the message contains a GUTI, the UE shall use this GUTI as new temporary identity for EPS services and shall store the new GUTI. If no GUTI was included by the MME in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the old GUTI shall be used. If the UE receives a new TAI list in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall consider the new TAI list as valid and the old TAI list as invalid; otherwise, the UE shall consider the old TAI list as valid. If the UE receives the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message from a PLMN for which a PLMN-specific attempt counter or PLMN-specific PS-attempt counter is maintained (see clause\u00a05.3.7b), then the UE shall reset these counters. If the UE maintains a counter for \"SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services\", then the UE shall reset this counter. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the T3412 extended value IE, then the UE shall use the T3412 extended value IE as periodic tracking area update timer (T3412). If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT contains T3412 value IE, but not T3412 extended value IE, then the UE shall use value in T3412 value IE as periodic tracking area update timer (T3412). If neither T3412 value IE nor T3412 extended value IE is included, the UE shall use the value currently stored, e.g. from a prior ATTACH ACCEPT or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the T3324 value IE, then the UE shall use the timer value for T3324 as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13], clause\u00a04.7.2.8. If the UE had initiated the tracking area updating procedure in EMM-IDLE mode to perform an inter-system change from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode and the nonceUE was included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the UE shall delete the nonceUE upon receipt of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If an EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall deactivate all those EPS bearers contexts locally (without peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the MME) which are active in the UE, but are indicated by the MME as being inactive. If a default EPS bearer context is marked as inactive in the EPS bearer context status IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and this default bearer is not associated with the last remaining PDN connection in the UE, the UE shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the MME. If only the PDN connection for emergency bearer services remains established, the UE shall consider itself attached for emergency bearer services only. If the default bearer is associated with the last remaining PDN connection of the UE in the MME, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the UE shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE. If the default EPS bearer context of a PDN connection established as a user-plane resource of an MA PDU session as specified in clause\u00a05.3 of 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.193\u00a0[61] is deactivated locally and the MA PDU session does not have user plane resources established on non-3GPP access in N1 mode, the UE shall perform a local release of the MA PDU session. If an EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE may choose to ignore all those EPS bearers which are indicated by the MME as being active but are inactive at the UE. If a Negotiated IMSI offset IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the MUSIM UE shall forward the IMSI offset value to lower layers. If a Negotiated IMSI offset IE is not included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and the EPS update type IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message does not indicate \"periodic updating\", the MUSIM UE shall indicate to lower layers to erase any IMSI offset value, if available. The MME may also include a list of equivalent PLMNs in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. Each entry in the list contains a PLMN code (MCC+MNC). The UE shall store the list as provided by the network, and if there is no PDN connection for emergency bearer services or PDN connection for RLOS established, the UE shall remove from the list any PLMN code that is already in the list of \"forbidden PLMNs\" or in the list of \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\". If the UE is not attached for emergency bearer services and there is a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the UE shall remove from the list of equivalent PLMNs any PLMN code present in the list of forbidden PLMNs or in the list of \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" when the PDN connection for emergency bearer services is released. In addition, the UE shall add to the stored list the PLMN code of the registered PLMN that sent the list. The UE shall replace the stored list on each receipt of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message does not contain a list, then the UE shall delete the stored list. If the UE is neither attached for emergency bearer services nor attached for access to RLOS, and if the PLMN identity of the registered PLMN is a member of the list of \"forbidden PLMNs\" or the list of \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\", any such PLMN identity shall be deleted from the corresponding list(s). The network may also indicate in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is active. If the UE is attached for emergency bearer services, the network shall indicate in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is not activated. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains: i)\tno indication that ISR is activated, the UE shall set the TIN to \"GUTI\" and shall stop the periodic routing area update timer T3312 or T3323, if running; ii)\tan indication that ISR is activated, then: -\tif the UE is required to perform routing area updating for IMS voice termination as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13], annex\u00a0P.5, the UE shall set the TIN to \"GUTI\" and shall stop the periodic routing area update timer T3312 or T3323, if running; -\tif the UE had initiated the tracking area updating procedure due to a change in UE network capability or change in DRX parameters, the UE shall set the TIN to \"GUTI\" and shall stop the periodic routing area update timer T3312 or T3323, if running; -\tif the UE had initiated the tracking area updating procedure due to a change in the UE's usage setting or the voice domain preference for E-UTRAN, the UE shall set the TIN to \"GUTI\" and shall stop the periodic routing area update timer T3312 or T3323, if running; or -\tthe UE shall regard a previously assigned P-TMSI and RAI as valid and registered with the network. If the TIN currently indicates \"P-TMSI\" and the periodic routing area update timer T3312 is running or is deactivated, the UE shall set the TIN to \"RAT-related TMSI\". If the TIN currently indicates \"P-TMSI\" and the periodic routing area update timer T3312 has already expired, the UE shall set the TIN to \"GUTI\". The network informs the UE about the support of specific features, such as IMS voice over PS session, location services (EPC-LCS, CS-LCS), emergency bearer services, or CIoT EPS optimizations, in the EPS network feature support information element. In a UE with IMS voice over PS capability, the IMS voice over PS session indicator and the emergency bearer services indicator shall be provided to the upper layers. The upper layers take the IMS voice over PS session indicator into account as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.221\u00a0[8A], clause\u00a07.2a and clause\u00a07.2b, when selecting the access domain for voice sessions or calls. When initiating an emergency call, the upper layers also take both the IMS voice over PS session indicator and the emergency bearer services indicator into account for the access domain selection. When the UE determines via the IMS voice over PS session indicator that the network does not support IMS voice over PS sessions in S1 mode, then the UE shall not locally release any persistent EPS bearer context. When the UE determines via the emergency bearer services indicator that the network does not support emergency bearer services in S1 mode, then the UE shall not locally release any emergency EPS bearer context if there is a radio bearer associated with that context. In a UE with LCS capability, location services indicators (EPC-LCS, CS-LCS) shall be provided to the upper layers. When MO-LR procedure is triggered by the UE's application, those indicators are taken into account as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.171\u00a0[13C]. If the MME received the list of TAIs from the satellite E-UTRAN as described in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10], and determines that, by UE subscription and operator's preferences any but not all TAIs in the received list of TAIs is forbidden for roaming or for regional provision of service, the MME shall include the TAI(s) in: a)\tthe Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" IE; b)\tthe Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\" IE; or c)\tboth, in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. NOTE\u00a08:\tVoid If the RestrictDCNR bit is set to \"Use of dual connectivity with NR is restricted\" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall provide the indication that dual connectivity with NR is restricted to the upper layers. The UE supporting N1 mode shall operate in the mode for inter-system interworking with 5GS as follows: -\tif the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to \"interworking without N26 interface not supported\", the UE shall operate in single-registration mode; -\tif the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to \"interworking without N26 interface supported\" and the UE supports dual-registration mode, the UE may operate in dual-registration mode; or NOTE\u00a09:\tThe registration mode used by the UE is implementation dependent. -\tif the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to \"interworking without N26 interface supported\" and the UE only supports single-registration mode, the UE shall operate in single-registration mode. The UE shall treat the interworking without N26 interface indicator as valid in the entire PLMN and equivalent PLMNs. The interworking procedures required for coordination between 5GMM and EMM without N26 interface are specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54]. If the redir-policy bit is set to \"Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed\" in the Network policy IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall set the network policy on unsecured redirection to GERAN for the current PLMN to \"Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed\" and indicate to the lower layers that unsecured redirection to a GERAN cell is not allowed. If the redir-policy bit is set to \"Unsecured redirection to GERAN allowed\" or if the Network policy IE is not included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall set the network policy on unsecured redirection to GERAN for the current PLMN to \"Unsecured redirection to GERAN allowed\" and indicate to the lower layers that unsecured redirection to a GERAN cell is allowed. The UE shall set the network policy on unsecured redirection to GERAN to \"Unsecured redirection to GERAN not allowed\" and indicate this to the lower layers when any of the following events occurs: -\tthe UE initiates an EPS attach or tracking area updating procedure in a PLMN different from the PLMN where the UE performed the last successful EPS attach or tracking area updating procedure; -\tthe UE is switched on; or -\tthe UICC containing the USIM is removed. If the UE has initiated the tracking area updating procedure due to manual CSG selection and receives a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and the UE sent the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message in a CSG cell, the UE shall check if the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the UE has sent the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message are contained in the Allowed CSG list. If not, the UE shall add that CSG ID and associated PLMN identity to the Allowed CSG list and the UE may add the HNB Name (if provided by lower layers) to the Allowed CSG list if the HNB Name is present in neither the Operator CSG list nor the Allowed CSG list. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contained a GUTI, the UE shall return a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message to the MME to acknowledge the received GUTI or the received Negotiated IMSI offset IE. If the UE has a negotiated IMSI offset value stored at the lower layers and the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message does not contain the Negotiated IMSI offset IE, the UE shall return a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message to the MME, and the MME shall erase the stored alternative IMSI value for the UE upon receiving the TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message. If the UE which was previously successfully attached for EPS and non-EPS services receives the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message with EPS update result IE indicating \"combined TA/LA updated\" or \"combined TA/LA updated and ISR activated\" as the response of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with EPS update type IE indicating \"periodic updating\", the UE shall behave as follows: -\tIf the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains an IMSI, the UE is not allocated any TMSI, and shall delete any old TMSI accordingly. -\tIf the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains a TMSI, the UE shall use this TMSI as new temporary identity. The UE shall delete its old TMSI and shall store the new TMSI. In this case, a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message is returned to the network to confirm the received TMSI. -\tIf neither a TMSI nor an IMSI has been included by the network in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the old TMSI, if any is available, shall be kept. If the header compression configuration status is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall stop using header compression and decompression for those EPS bearers using Control plane CIoT EPS optimisation for which the MME indicated that the header compression configuration is not used. If the T3448 value IE is present in the received TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall: -\tstop timer T3448 if it is running; and -\tstart timer T3448 with the value provided in the T3448 value IE. If the UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization, the T3448 value IE is present in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and the value indicates that this timer is either zero or deactivated, the UE shall consider this case as an abnormal case and proceed as if the T3448 value IE is not present. If the UE in EMM-IDLE mode initiated the tracking area updating procedure and the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message does not include the T3448 value IE and if timer T3448 is running, then the UE shall stop timer T3448. If the UE has indicated \"service gap control supported\" in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and: -\tthe TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the T3447 value IE, then the UE shall store the new T3447 value, erase any previous stored T3447 value if exists and use the new T3447 value with the T3447 timer next time it is started; or -\tthe TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message does not contain the T3447 value IE, then the UE shall erase any previous stored T3447 value if exists and stop the T3447 timer if running. Upon receiving a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message, the MME shall stop timer T3450 and change to state EMM-REGISTERED. The GUTI, the Negotiated IMSI offset, or both, if sent in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, shall be considered as valid. NOTE\u00a010:\tUpon receiving a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message, if a new TMSI was included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the MME sends an SGsAP-TMSI-REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.118\u00a0[16A]. For inter-system change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode, if the UE has included an eKSI in the NAS Key Set Identifier IE indicating a current EPS security context in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message by which the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is integrity protected, the MME shall take one of the following actions: -\tif the MME retrieves the current EPS security context as indicated by the eKSI and GUTI sent by the UE, the MME shall integrity check the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message using the current EPS security context and integrity protect the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message using the current EPS security context; -\tif the MME cannot retrieve the current EPS security context as indicated by the eKSI and GUTI sent by the UE, and if the UE has included a valid GPRS ciphering key sequence number, the MME shall create a new mapped EPS security context as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19], and then perform a security mode control procedure to indicate the use of the new mapped EPS security context to the UE (see clause\u00a05.4.3.2); or -\tif the UE has not included an Additional GUTI IE, the MME may treat the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message as in the previous item, i.e. as if it cannot retrieve the current EPS security context. NOTE\u00a011:\tThe handling described above at failure to retrieve the current EPS security context or if no Additional GUTI IE was provided does not preclude the option for the MME to perform an EPS authentication procedure and create a new native EPS security context. For inter-system change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode, if the UE has not included a valid eKSI in the NAS Key Set Identifier IE and has included a valid GPRS ciphering key sequence number in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall create a new mapped EPS security context as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19], and then perform a security mode control procedure to indicate the use of the new mapped EPS security context to the UE (see clause\u00a05.4.3.2). NOTE\u00a012:\tThis does not preclude the option for the MME to perform an EPS authentication procedure and create a new native EPS security context. For inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode, if the UE has included an eKSI in the NAS Key Set Identifier IE indicating a 5G NAS security context in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message by which the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is integrity protected, the MME shall take actions as specified in clause\u00a04.4.2.3. For inter-system change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode in EMM-CONNECTED mode, the MME shall integrity check TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message using the current K'ASME as derived when triggering the handover to E-UTRAN (see clause\u00a04.4.2.2). The MME shall verify the received UE security capabilities in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. The MME shall then take one of the following actions: -\tif the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST does not contain a valid KSIASME in the Non-current native NAS key set identifier IE, the MME shall remove the non-current native EPS security context, if any, for any GUTI for this UE. The MME shall then integrity protect and cipher the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message using the security context based on K'ASME and take the mapped EPS security context into use; or -\tif the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST contains a valid KSIASME in the Non-current native NAS key set identifier IE, the MME may initiate a security mode control procedure to take the corresponding native EPS security context into use. For inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-CONNECTED mode, the MME shall integrity check TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message using the current K'ASME as derived when triggering the handover to E-UTRAN (see clause\u00a04.4.2.2). The MME shall verify the received UE security capabilities in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. The MME shall then take one of the following actions: -\tif the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST does not contain a valid KSIASME in the Non-current native NAS key set identifier IE, the MME shall remove the non-current native EPS security context, if any, for any GUTI for this UE. The MME shall then integrity protect and cipher the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message using the security context based on K'ASME and take the mapped EPS security context into use; or -\tif the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST contains a valid KSIASME in the Non-current native NAS key set identifier IE, the MME may initiate a security mode control procedure to take the corresponding native EPS security context into use. In WB-S1 mode, if the UE has set the RACS bit to \"RACS supported\" in the UE network capability IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME may include a UE radio capability ID IE or a UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. In this case the MME shall enter state EMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in clause\u00a05.4.1. In WB-S1 mode, if the UE has set the RACS bit to \"RACS supported\" in the UE network capability IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message includes: -\ta UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE set to \"Network-assigned UE radio capability IDs deletion requested\", the UE shall: a)\tdelete any network-assigned UE radio capability IDs associated with the registered PLMN stored at the UE; b)\tsend a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message to the network to acknowledge the received UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE; and c)\tafter the completion of the ongoing tracking area updating procedure, initiate a tracking area updating procedure as specified in clause\u00a05.5.3 over the existing NAS signalling connection except if there is a pending service request procedure as response to paging for CS fallback; and -\ta UE radio capability ID IE, the UE shall: a)\tstore the UE radio capability ID as specified in annex\u00a0C; and b)\tsend a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message to the network to acknowledge the received UE radio capability ID IE. If the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" IE in the TRACKING ARE UPDATE ACCEPT message and the TAI(s) included in the IE is not part of the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\", the UE shall store the TAI(s) included in the IE into the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" and remove the TAI(s) from the stored TAI list if present. If the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\" IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and the TAI(s) included in the IE is not part of the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\", the UE shall store the TAI(s) included in the IE into the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\" and remove the TAI(s) from the stored TAI list if present. 5.5.3.2.4A\tTracking area updating successful for EPS services and not accepted for SMS services Apart from the actions on the tracking area updating attempt counter, the description for tracking area update for EPS services as specified in clause\u00a05.5.3.2.4 shall be followed. In addition, the following description for tracking area updating for SMS services applies. In NB-S1 mode, if the UE requested \"SMS only\" in the Additional update type IE and supports NB-S1 mode only, the MME decides to accept the tracking area update request for EPS services only and: -\tthe location update for non-EPS services is not accepted by the VLR as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.118\u00a0[16A]; or -\tthe MME decides to not accept the tracking area update request for \"SMS only\", the MME shall set the EPS update result IE to \"EPS only\", shall not indicate \"SMS only\" in the Additional update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and shall include an appropriate SMS services status value. The UE receiving the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message takes one of the following actions depending on the value included in the SMS services status IE: \"SMS services not available\" The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running, shall reset the tracking area updating attempt counter, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The USIM shall be considered as invalid for SMS services until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described in clause\u00a05.3.7a. \"SMS services not available in this PLMN\" The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running, shall reset the tracking area updating attempt counter, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The UE may provide a notification to the user or the upper layers that the SMS services are not available. The UE shall not attempt normal attach or tracking area updating procedures indicating \"SMS only\" with current PLMN until switching off the UE or the UICC containing the USIM is removed. Additionally, the UE may perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[6]. \"Network failure\" The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running. The tracking area updating attempt counter shall be incremented, unless it was already set to 5. If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5: -\tthe UE shall start timer T3411, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer T3411 expires the normal tracking area updating procedure for EPS services and \"SMS only\" or the combined tracking area updating procedure for EPS services and \"SMS only\" is triggered. If the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5: -\tthe UE shall start timer T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer T3402 expires the normal tracking area updating procedure for EPS services and \"SMS only\" or the combined tracking area updating procedure for EPS services and \"SMS only\" is triggered. \"Congestion\" The UE shall stop the timer T3430 if still running. The tracking area updating attempt counter shall be set to\u00a05. The UE shall start the timer T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED, and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer T3402 expires the normal tracking area updating procedure for EPS services and \"SMS only\" or the combined tracking area updating procedure for EPS services and \"SMS only\" is triggered. Other values are considered as abnormal cases. The tracking area updating procedure shall be considered as failed for SMS services. The behaviour of the UE in those cases is specified in clause\u00a05.5.3.2.6A.",

NOTE\u00a01:\tDependent on implementation and operator configuration the area A can be configured with the granularity of an MME area, tracking area or eNodeB service area. The MME may further be configured for a certain area A' to exempt service requests for mobile originating CS fallback calls from this MME-based access control, if: -\tthe service request is initiated in EMM-IDLE mode; and -\tthe UE indicated support of eNodeB-based access control for mobile originating CS fallback calls during an attach or tracking area updating procedure. NOTE\u00a02:\tThe operator can use this second option when the eNodeBs in area A' are supporting the eNodeB-based access control for CS fallback calls. The area A' can be part of area A or the whole area A. It is the responsibility of the operator to coordinate the activation of MME-based access control and eNodeB-based access control for mobile originating CS fallback calls.

The UE shall enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE. The UE shall store the current TAI in the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" and remove the current TAI from the stored TAI list if present. The UE shall search for a suitable cell in another tracking area or in another location area in the same PLMN according to 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.304\u00a0[21].

If the rejected request was not for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, the UE shall abort the service request procedure and enter state EMM-REGISTERED, and stop timer T3417 or T3417ext if still running. The UE shall stop timer T3346 if it is running. If the SERVICE REJECT message is integrity protected, the UE shall start timer T3346 with the value provided in the T3346 value IE. If the SERVICE REJECT message is not integrity protected, the UE shall start timer T3346 with a random value from the default range specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13]. If the service request was initiated for CS fallback, the UE in CS/PS mode 1 of operation shall select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. It then proceeds with appropriate MM and CC specific procedures. The EMM sublayer shall not indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer. NOTE\u00a07:\tIf the UE disables the E-UTRA capability, then subsequent mobile terminating calls could fail. If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback, the UE shall select cdma2000\u00ae 1x radio access technology. The UE then proceeds with appropriate cdma2000\u00ae 1x CS call processing. For all other cases the UE stays in the current serving cell and applies normal cell reselection process. The service request procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is stopped. #25\t(Not authorized for this CSG); EMM cause #25 is only applicable when received from a CSG cell. EMM cause #25 received from a non-CSG cell is considered as an abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE is specified in subclause\u00a05.6.1.6. If the SERVICE REJECT message with EMM cause #25 was received without integrity protection, then the UE shall discard the message. The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to subclause\u00a05.1.3.3). The UE shall enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE. If the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the UE has initiated the service request procedure are contained in the Allowed CSG list, the UE shall remove the entry corresponding to this CSG ID and associated PLMN identity from the Allowed CSG list. If the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the UE has initiated the service request procedure are contained in the Operator CSG list, the UE shall apply the procedures defined in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[6] subclause\u00a03.1A. The UE shall search for a suitable cell in the same PLMN according to 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.304\u00a0[21]. If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the GMM parameters GMM state and GPRS update status as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13] for the case when the service request procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with the same value. #39\t(CS service temporarily not available); If the T3442 value received in the SERVICE REJECT message is not zero, the UE shall start timer T3442 and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. If the T3442 value received in the SERVICE REJECT message is zero, the UE shall not start timer T3442. The UE shall not try to send an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message for mobile originating CS fallback to the network, except for mobile originating CS fallback for emergency calls, until timer T3442 expires or the UE sends a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. #40\t(No EPS bearer context activated); The UE shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The UE shall delete any mapped EPS security context or partial native EPS security context. If the service request was initiated for CS fallback, the UE shall select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. It then proceeds with appropriate MM and CC specific procedures. The EMM sublayer shall not indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer. If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback, the UE shall select cdma2000\u00ae 1x radio access technology. The UE then proceeds with appropriate cdma2000\u00ae 1x CS procedures. If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback and the UE has dual Rx/Tx configuration and supports enhanced 1xCS fallback, the UE shall perform a new attach procedure. If the service request was initiated for any reason other than CS fallback or 1x CS fallback, the UE shall perform a new attach procedure. NOTE\u00a08:\tUser interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot re-activate the EPS bearer(s) automatically. If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the GMM state as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13] for the case when the service request procedure is rejected with the GMM cause value #10 \"Implicitly detached\". A UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation which is already IMSI attached for non-EPS services is still IMSI attached for non-EPS services in the network. Other values are considered as abnormal cases.

Then if the UE is in the same selected PLMN where the last service request was attempted, the UE shall: a)\tinform the upper layers. This could result in the UE attempting a CS emergency call (if not already attempted in the CS domain) or other implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.229\u00a0[13D] that can result in the emergency call being attempted to another IP-CAN; or b)\tdetach locally, if not detached already, attempt EPS attach for emergency bearer services.",

NOTE\u00a01:\tA service request can only be rejected before the network has initiated any procedure which will be interpreted by the UE as successful completion of the service request procedure (see clauses\u00a05.6.1.4.1 and 5.6.1.4.2) and which will trigger a transition from state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED to EMM-REGISTERED on the UE side. Based on local policies or configurations in the MME, if the MME determines to change the periodic tracking area update timer (T3412), or if the MME determines to change the PSM usage or the value of timer T3324 in the UE for which PSM is allowed by the MME, the MME may return a SERVICE REJECT with the cause #10 \"implicitly detached\" to the UE. Based on operator policy, if the service request procedure is rejected due to core network redirection for CIoT optimizations, the network shall set the EMM cause value to #31 \"Redirection to 5GCN required\". NOTE\u00a02:\tThe network can take into account the UE's N1 mode capability, the 5GS CIoT network behaviour supported by the UE or the 5GS CIoT network behaviour supported by the 5GCN to determine the rejection with the EMM cause value #31 \"Redirection to 5GCN required\". The MME may be configured to perform MME-based access control for mobile originating CS fallback calls for a certain area A by rejecting related service request with EMM cause #39 \"CS service temporarily not available\". NOTE\u00a03:\tDependent on implementation and operator configuration the area A can be configured with the granularity of an MME area, tracking area or eNodeB service area. The MME may further be configured for a certain area A' to exempt service requests for mobile originating CS fallback calls from this MME-based access control, if: -\tthe service request is initiated in EMM-IDLE mode; and -\tthe UE indicated support of eNodeB-based access control for mobile originating CS fallback calls during an attach or tracking area updating procedure. NOTE\u00a04:\tThe operator can use this second option when the eNodeBs in area A' are supporting the eNodeB-based access control for CS fallback calls. The area A' can be part of area A or the whole area A. It is the responsibility of the operator to coordinate the activation of MME-based access control and eNodeB-based access control for mobile originating CS fallback calls. When the EMM cause value is #39 \"CS service temporarily not available\", the MME shall include a value for timer T3442 in the SERVICE REJECT message. If a mobile terminating CS fallback call is aborted by the network during call establishment as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.118\u00a0[], the MME shall include the EMM cause value #39 \"CS service temporarily not available\" and set the value of timer T3442 to zero. If a service request from a UE with only LIPA PDN connections is not accepted due to the reasons specified in clause\u00a05.6.1.4, depending on the service request received, the MME shall include the following EMM cause value in the SERVICE REJECT message: -\tif the service request received is not due to CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, EMM cause value #10 \"implicitly detached\"; or -\tif the service request received is due to CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, EMM cause value #40 \"no EPS bearer context activated\". If a service request from a UE with only remaining SIPTO at the local network PDN connections is not accepted due to the reasons specified in clause\u00a05.6.1.4, depending on the service request received, the MME shall: -\tif the service request received is due to CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, include the EMM cause value #40 \"no EPS bearer context activated\" in the SERVICE REJECT message; or -\tif the service request received is not due to CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, abort the service request procedure and send a DETACH REQUEST message to the UE with detach type \"re-attach required\" (see clause\u00a05.5.2.3.1). If the service request for mobile originated services is rejected due to general NAS level mobility management congestion control, the network shall set the EMM cause value to #22 \"congestion\" and assign a value for back-off timer T3346. In NB-S1 mode, if the service request for mobile originated services is rejected due to operator determined barring (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.272\u00a0[16C]), the network shall set the EMM cause value to #22 \"congestion\" and assign a value for back-off timer T3346. If the service request for mobile originated services is rejected due to service gap control as specified in clause\u00a05.3.17 i.e. the T3447 timer is running, the network shall set the EMM cause value to #22 \"congestion\" and may assign a back-off timer T3346 with the remaining time of the running T3447 timer. If the MME sends a SERVICE REJECT message upon receipt of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message piggybacked with the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message: -\tif the Release assistance indication IE is not set to \"No further uplink and no further downlink data transmission subsequent to the uplink data transmission is expected\" in the message; -\tif the UE has indicated a support for the control plane data back-off timer; and -\tif the MME decides to activate the congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane, then the MME shall set the EMM cause value to #22 \"congestion\" and assign a value for control plane data back-off timer T3448. In NB-S1 mode or WB-S1 mode via satellite E-UTRAN access, if the service request is from a UE via a satellite E-UTRA cell and the network using the User Location Information provided by the eNodeB (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[23]), is able to determine that the UE is in a location where the network is not allowed to operate, the network shall set the EMM cause value in the SERVICE REJECT message to #78 \"PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE location\". On receipt of the SERVICE REJECT message, if the UE is in state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED and the message is integrity protected or contains a reject cause other than EMM cause value #25, the UE shall reset the service request attempt counter, stop timer T3417, T3417ext or T3417ext-mt, if running. If the SERVICE REJECT message with EMM cause #25 was received without integrity protection, then the UE shall discard the message. If the MME received multiple TAIs from the satellite E-UTRAN as described in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.501\u00a0[10], and determines that, by UE subscription and operator's preferences, all of the received TAIs are forbidden for roaming or for regional provision of service, the MME shall include the TAI(s) in: a)\tthe Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" IE; b)\tthe Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\" IE; or c)\tboth, in the SERVICE REJECT message. Regardless of the EMM cause value received in the SERVICE REJECT message via satellite E-UTRAN, -\tif the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" IE in the SERVICE REJECT message, the UE shall store the TAI(s) included in the IE, if not already stored, into the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\"; and -\tif the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\" IE in the SERVICE REJECT message, the UE shall store the TAI(s) included in the IE, if not already stored, into the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\" Furthermore, the UE shall take the following actions depending on the received EMM cause value in the SERVICE REJECT message. #3\t(Illegal UE); #6\t(Illegal ME); or #8\t(EPS services and non-EPS services not allowed); The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to clause\u00a05.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. The UE shall consider the USIM as invalid for EPS services until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described in clause\u00a05.3.7a. Additionally, the UE shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs and shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-IMSI. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a counter for \"SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services\", then the UE shall set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value.

If the service request was initiated for CS fallback for emergency call and a CS fallback cancellation request was not received, the UE may attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. It then proceeds with appropriate MM and CC specific procedures. The EMM sublayer shall not indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer. If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback, the UE shall select cdma2000\u00ae 1x radio access technology. The UE then proceeds with appropriate cdma2000\u00ae 1x CS procedures. If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback for emergency call, the UE may select cdma2000\u00ae 1x radio access technology. The UE then proceeds with appropriate cdma2000\u00ae 1x CS procedures. If the service request was initiated in EMM-CONNECTED mode with Control plane service type \"mobile originating request\" and with the \"active\" flag set to 1, the UE shall abort the procedure. If the service request procedure was initiated for an MO MMTEL voice call or an MO MMTEL video call is started, a notification that the service request was not accepted due to congestion shall be provided to the upper layers.

For all other cases the UE stays in the current serving cell and applies normal cell reselection process. The service request procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is stopped. If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the GMM parameters GMM state and GPRS update status as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13] for the case when the service request procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with the same value. If the UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization and if the T3448 value IE is present in the SERVICE REJECT message and the value indicates that this timer is neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall: -\tstop timer T3448 if it is running; -\tconsider the transport of user data via the control plane as unsuccessful; and -\tstart timer T3448: -\twith the value provided in the T3448 value IE if the SERVICE REJECT message is integrity protected; or -\twith a random value from the default range specified in table\u00a010.2.1 if the SERVICE REJECT message is not integrity protected. If the UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization and if the T3448 value IE is present in the SERVICE REJECT message and the value indicates that this timer is either zero or deactivated, the UE shall ignore the T3448 value IE and-\tstop timer T3448 if it is running; and -\tconsider the transport of user data via the control plane as unsuccessful. If the UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization and if the T3448 value IE is not present in the SERVICE REJECT message, it shall be considered as an abnormal case and the behaviour of UE for this case is specified in clause\u00a05.6.1.6. If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM parameters, 5GMM state and 5GS update status as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54] for the case when the service request procedure performed over 3GPP access is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same value. #25\t(Not authorized for this CSG); EMM cause #25 is only applicable when received from a CSG cell. EMM cause #25 received from a non-CSG cell is considered as an abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE is specified in clause\u00a05.6.1.6. The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and store it according to clause\u00a05.1.3.3). The UE shall enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE. If the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the UE has initiated the service request procedure are contained in the Allowed CSG list, the UE shall remove the entry corresponding to this CSG ID and associated PLMN identity from the Allowed CSG list. If the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the UE has initiated the service request procedure are contained in the Operator CSG list, the UE shall apply the procedures defined in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[6] clause\u00a03.1A. The UE shall search for a suitable cell according to 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.304\u00a0[21]. If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the GMM parameters GMM state and GPRS update status as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13] for the case when the service request procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with the same value. If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition set the 5GMM state to 5GMM-REGISTERED and set the 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED. #31\t(Redirection to 5GCN required); EMM cause #31 received by a UE that has not indicated support for CIoT optimizations is considered as an abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE is specified in clause\u00a05.6.1.6. The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to clause\u00a05.1.3.3). The UE shall reset the service request attempt counter and shall enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE. The UE shall enable N1 mode capability for 3GPP access if it was disabled and disable the E-UTRA capability (see clause\u00a04.5). If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM parameters, 5GMM state, and 5GS update status as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54] for the case when the service request procedure performed over 3GPP access is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same value. #36\t(IAB-node operation not authorized); The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to subclause\u00a05.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. The UE shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs and shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH. The UE shall store the PLMN identity in the \"forbidden PLMN list\" and if the UE is configured to use timer T3245 (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A] or 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]) then the UE shall start timer T3245 and proceed as described in subclause\u00a05.3.7a. If the message has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a PLMN-specific attempt counter for that PLMN, then the UE shall set this counter to the UE implementation-specific maximum value. The UE shall perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[6]. If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status, 5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54] for the case when the service request procedure performed over 3GPP access is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same value. #39\t(CS service temporarily not available); If the T3442 value received in the SERVICE REJECT message is not zero, the UE shall start timer T3442 and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. If the T3442 value received in the SERVICE REJECT message is zero, the UE shall not start timer T3442. The UE shall not try to send an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message for mobile originating CS fallback to the network, except for mobile originating CS fallback for emergency calls, until timer T3442 expires or the UE sends a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. #40\t(No EPS bearer context activated); The UE shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The UE shall delete any mapped EPS security context or partial native EPS security context. If the service request was initiated for CS fallback and a CS fallback cancellation request was not received, the UE shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell, it then proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures and the EMM sublayer shall not indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer. Otherwise the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer. If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback, the UE shall select cdma2000\u00ae 1x radio access technology. The UE then proceeds with appropriate cdma2000\u00ae 1x CS procedures. If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback and the UE has dual Rx/Tx configuration and supports enhanced 1xCS fallback, the UE shall perform a new attach procedure. If the service request was initiated for any reason other than CS fallback, 1x CS fallback or initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, the UE shall perform a new attach procedure. NOTE\u00a010:\tUser interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot re-activate the EPS bearer(s) automatically. If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the GMM state as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13] for the case when the service request procedure is rejected with the GMM cause value #10 \"Implicitly detached\". A UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation which is already IMSI attached for non-EPS services is still IMSI attached for non-EPS services in the network. A UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation shall set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED. If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition set the 5GMM state to 5GMM-DEREGISTERED. #42\t(Severe network failure); The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED, and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list, eKSI, and list of equivalent PLMNs. The UE shall start an implementation specific timer, setting its value to 2 times the value of T as defined in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[6]. While this timer is running, the UE shall not consider the PLMN + RAT combination that provided this reject cause as a candidate for PLMN selection. The UE then enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[6]. If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition set the GMM state to GMM-DEREGISTERED, GPRS update status to GU2 NOT UPDATED, MM update status to U2 NOT UPDATED and shall delete the P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number, LAI, TMSI and ciphering key sequence number. If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition set the 5GMM state to 5GMM-DEREGISTERED, 5GS update status to 5U2 NOT UPDATED, and shall delete any 5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI. #78\t(PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE location). This cause value received from a non-satellite E-UTRA cell is considered as an abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE is specified in clause\u00a05.5.6.1.6. The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to clause\u00a05.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. Additionally, the UE shall reset the registration attempt counter. The UE shall store the PLMN identity and, if it is known, the current geographical location in the list of \"PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location\", start a corresponding timer instance (see clause\u00a04.11.2), enter state EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH and perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[6]. If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM parameters, 5GMM state, and 5GS update status as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54] for the case when the service request procedure performed over 3GPP access is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same value. Other values are considered as abnormal cases. The specification of the UE behaviour in those cases is described in clause\u00a05.6.1.6. 5.6.1.5A\tService request procedure for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services not accepted by the network If the service request for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services cannot be accepted by the network, the UE shall perform the procedures as described in clause\u00a05.6.1.5.

NOTE\u00a01:\tA service request can only be rejected before the network has initiated any procedure which will be interpreted by the UE as successful completion of the service request procedure (see clauses\u00a05.6.1.4.1 and 5.6.1.4.2) and which will trigger a transition from state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED to EMM-REGISTERED on the UE side. Based on local policies or configurations in the MME, if the MME determines to change the periodic tracking area update timer (T3412), or if the MME determines to change the PSM usage or the value of timer T3324 in the UE for which PSM is allowed by the MME, the MME may return a SERVICE REJECT with the cause #10 \"implicitly detached\" to the UE. Based on operator policy, if the service request procedure is rejected due to core network redirection for CIoT optimizations, the network shall set the EMM cause value to #31 \"Redirection to 5GCN required\". NOTE\u00a02:\tThe network can take into account the UE's N1 mode capability, the 5GS CIoT network behaviour supported by the UE or the 5GS CIoT network behaviour supported by the 5GCN to determine the rejection with the EMM cause value #31 \"Redirection to 5GCN required\". The MME may be configured to perform MME-based access control for mobile originating CS fallback calls for a certain area A by rejecting related service request with EMM cause #39 \"CS service temporarily not available\". NOTE\u00a03:\tDependent on implementation and operator configuration the area A can be configured with the granularity of an MME area, tracking area or eNodeB service area. The MME may further be configured for a certain area A' to exempt service requests for mobile originating CS fallback calls from this MME-based access control, if: -\tthe service request is initiated in EMM-IDLE mode; and -\tthe UE indicated support of eNodeB-based access control for mobile originating CS fallback calls during an attach or tracking area updating procedure. NOTE\u00a04:\tThe operator can use this second option when the eNodeBs in area A' are supporting the eNodeB-based access control for CS fallback calls. The area A' can be part of area A or the whole area A. It is the responsibility of the operator to coordinate the activation of MME-based access control and eNodeB-based access control for mobile originating CS fallback calls. When the EMM cause value is #39 \"CS service temporarily not available\", the MME shall include a value for timer T3442 in the SERVICE REJECT message. If a mobile terminating CS fallback call is aborted by the network during call establishment as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.118\u00a0[], the MME shall include the EMM cause value #39 \"CS service temporarily not available\" and set the value of timer T3442 to zero. If a service request from a UE with only LIPA PDN connections is not accepted due to the reasons specified in clause\u00a05.6.1.4, depending on the service request received, the MME shall include the following EMM cause value in the SERVICE REJECT message: -\tif the service request received is not due to CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, EMM cause value #10 \"implicitly detached\"; or -\tif the service request received is due to CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, EMM cause value #40 \"no EPS bearer context activated\". If a service request from a UE with only remaining SIPTO at the local network PDN connections is not accepted due to the reasons specified in clause\u00a05.6.1.4, depending on the service request received, the MME shall: -\tif the service request received is due to CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, include the EMM cause value #40 \"no EPS bearer context activated\" in the SERVICE REJECT message; or -\tif the service request received is not due to CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, abort the service request procedure and send a DETACH REQUEST message to the UE with detach type \"re-attach required\" (see clause\u00a05.5.2.3.1). If the service request for mobile originated services is rejected due to general NAS level mobility management congestion control, the network shall set the EMM cause value to #22 \"congestion\" and assign a value for back-off timer T3346. In NB-S1 mode, if the service request for mobile originated services is rejected due to operator determined barring (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.272\u00a0[16C]), the network shall set the EMM cause value to #22 \"congestion\" and assign a value for back-off timer T3346. If the service request for mobile originated services is rejected due to service gap control as specified in clause\u00a05.3.17 i.e. the T3447 timer is running, the network shall set the EMM cause value to #22 \"congestion\" and may assign a back-off timer T3346 with the remaining time of the running T3447 timer. If the MME sends a SERVICE REJECT message upon receipt of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message piggybacked with the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message: -\tif the Release assistance indication IE is not set to \"No further uplink and no further downlink data transmission subsequent to the uplink data transmission is expected\" in the message; -\tif the UE has indicated a support for the control plane data back-off timer; and -\tif the MME decides to activate the congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane, then the MME shall set the EMM cause value to #22 \"congestion\" and assign a value for control plane data back-off timer T3448. In NB-S1 mode or WB-S1 mode via satellite E-UTRAN access, if the service request is from a UE via a satellite E-UTRA cell and the network using the User Location Information provided by the eNodeB (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[23]), is able to determine that the UE is in a location where the network is not allowed to operate, the network shall set the EMM cause value in the SERVICE REJECT message to #78 \"PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE location\". On receipt of the SERVICE REJECT message, if the UE is in state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED and the message is integrity protected or contains a reject cause other than EMM cause value #25, the UE shall reset the service request attempt counter, stop timer T3417, T3417ext or T3417ext-mt, if running. If the SERVICE REJECT message with EMM cause #25 was received without integrity protection, then the UE shall discard the message. If the MME received multiple TAIs from the satellite E-UTRAN as described in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.501\u00a0[10], and determines that, by UE subscription and operator's preferences, all of the received TAIs are forbidden for roaming or for regional provision of service, the MME shall include the TAI(s) in: a)\tthe Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" IE; b)\tthe Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\" IE; or c)\tboth, in the SERVICE REJECT message.

The UE shall consider the USIM as invalid for EPS services until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described in clause\u00a05.3.7a. Additionally, the UE shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs and shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-IMSI.

The UE shall enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The UE shall set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED. If the UE is in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with \"IMS voice not available\" and the request was related to CS fallback, the UE shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology and disable the E-UTRA capability (see clause 4.5). If the UE is in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 mode of operation, the UE may provide a notification to the user or the upper layers that the CS domain is not available. If the request was related to 1xCS fallback, the UE shall cancel upper layer actions related to 1xCS fallback and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. #22\t(Congestion); If the T3346 value IE is present in the SERVICE REJECT message and the value indicates that this timer is neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall proceed as described below, otherwise it shall be considered as an abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE for this case is specified in clause\u00a05.6.1.6. If the rejected request was not for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, the UE shall abort the service request procedure and enter state EMM-REGISTERED, and stop timer T3417, T3417ext or T3417ext-mt if still running. The UE shall stop timer T3346 if it is running. If the SERVICE REJECT message is integrity protected, the UE shall start timer T3346 with the value provided in the T3346 value IE. If the SERVICE REJECT message is not integrity protected, the UE shall start timer T3346 with a random value from the default range specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13]. If the service request was initiated for CS fallback and a CS fallback cancellation request was not received, the UE in CS/PS mode 1 of operation shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell, it then proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures and the EMM sublayer shall not indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer. Otherwise the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer. NOTE\u00a08:\tIf the UE disables the E-UTRA capability, then subsequent mobile terminating calls could fail. If the service request was initiated for CS fallback for emergency call and a CS fallback cancellation request was not received, the UE may attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. It then proceeds with appropriate MM and CC specific procedures. The EMM sublayer shall not indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer. If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback, the UE shall select cdma2000\u00ae 1x radio access technology. The UE then proceeds with appropriate cdma2000\u00ae 1x CS procedures. If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback for emergency call, the UE may select cdma2000\u00ae 1x radio access technology. The UE then proceeds with appropriate cdma2000\u00ae 1x CS procedures. If the service request was initiated in EMM-CONNECTED mode with Control plane service type \"mobile originating request\" and with the \"active\" flag set to 1, the UE shall abort the procedure. If the service request procedure was initiated for an MO MMTEL voice call or an MO MMTEL video call is started, a notification that the service request was not accepted due to congestion shall be provided to the upper layers.

If E-UTRA capability was disabled for any other reason, the UE shall enable the E-UTRA capability in the following cases: -\tthe UE mode of operation changes from CS/PS mode 1 of operation to CS/PS mode 2 of operation; -\tthe UE mode of operation changes from PS mode 1 of operation to PS mode 2 of operation; or -\tthe UE powers off and powers on again or the USIM is removed; As an implementation option, the UE may start a timer for enabling E-UTRA when the UE's attach attempt counter or tracking area updating attempt counter reaches\u00a05 and the UE disables E-UTRA capability for cases described in clauses\u00a05.5.1.2.6, 5.5.1.3.4.3, 5.5.1.3.6, 5.5.3.2.6, 5.5.3.3.4.3 and 5.5.3.3.6. The UE should memorize the identity of the PLMNs where E-UTRA capability were disabled. On expiry of this timer: -\tif the UE is in Iu mode or A/Gb mode and is in idle mode as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13] on expiry of the timer, the UE should enable the E-UTRA capability; -\tif the UE is in Iu mode or A/Gb mode and an RR connection exists, the UE shall delay enabling E-UTRA capability until the RR connection is released; -\tif the UE is in Iu mode and a PS signalling connection exists but no RR connection exists, the UE may abort the PS signalling connection before enabling E-UTRA capability; -\tif the UE is in N1 mode and is in 5GMM-IDLE mode as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54], on expiry of the timer, the UE should enable the E-UTRA capability; and -\tif the UE is in N1 mode and is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54], on expiry of the timer, the UE shall delay enabling the E-UTRA capability until the N1 NAS signalling connection is released. If the UE attempts to establish an emergency bearer service or to access RLOS in a PLMN where the E-UTRA capability was disabled due to the UE's attach attempt counter or tracking area updating attempt counter have reached\u00a05, the UE may enable the E-UTRA capability for that PLMN memorized by the UE. The UE may support being configured for No E-UTRA Disabling In 5GS (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[50] or 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]). If the UE supports being configured for No E-UTRA Disabling in 5GS, No E-UTRA Disabling In 5GS is enabled if the corresponding configuration parameter is present and set to enabled. Otherwise, No E-UTRA Disabling In 5GS is disabled. If No E-UTRA Disabling In 5GS is enabled at the UE and the UE selects an NG-RAN cell in a PLMN where the E-UTRA capability was disabled due to the UE's attach attempt counter or tracking area updating attempt counter having reached\u00a05, the UE shall enable the E-UTRA capability for that PLMN. For other cases, it is up to the UE implementation when to enable the E-UTRA capability. NOTE:\tIf the UE is not operating in CS/PS mode 1 operation, the value of the timer for enabling E-UTRA capability is recommended to be not larger than the default value of T3402.",

If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, the attach request included a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, the attach procedure fails due to: -\ta default EPS bearer setup failure; -\tan ESM procedure failure; or -\toperator determined barring is applied on default EPS bearer context activation during attach procedure, the MME shall: -\tcombine the ATTACH REJECT message with a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message contained in the ESM message container information element. In this case the EMM cause value in the ATTACH REJECT message shall be set to #19 \"ESM failure\"; or -\tsend the ATTACH REJECT message with the EMM cause set to #15 \"No suitable cells in tracking area\", if the PDN connectivity reject is due to ESM cause #29 subject to operator policies (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.274\u00a0[16D] for further details). In this case, the network may additionally include the Extended EMM cause IE with value \"E-UTRAN not allowed\". If the attach request is rejected due to NAS level mobility management congestion control, the network shall set the EMM cause value to #22 \"congestion\" and assign a value for back-off timer T3346. In NB-S1 mode, if the attach request is rejected due to operator determined barring (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.272\u00a0[16C]), the network shall set the EMM cause value to #22 \"congestion\" and assign a value for back-off timer T3346. If the attach request is rejected due to service gap control as specified in clause\u00a05.3.17 i.e. the T3447 timer is running, the network shall set the EMM cause value to #22 \"congestion\" and may assign a back-off timer T3346 with the remaining time of the running T3447 timer. If the attach request is rejected due to incompatibility between the CIoT EPS optimizations supported by the UE and what the network supports and the network sets the EMM cause value to #15 \"no suitable cells in tracking area\", the network may additionally include the Extended EMM cause IE with value \"requested EPS optimization not supported\". NOTE\u00a01:\tHow the UE uses the Extended EMM cause IE with value \"requested EPS optimization not supported\" is implementation specific. The UE still behaves according to the EMM cause value #15. Based on operator policy, if the attach request is rejected due to core network redirection for CIoT optimizations, the network shall set the EMM cause value to #31 \"Redirection to 5GCN required\". NOTE\u00a02:\tThe network can take into account the UE's N1 mode capability, the 5GS CIoT network behaviour supported by the UE or the 5GS CIoT network behaviour supported by the 5GCN to determine the rejection with the EMM cause value #31 \"Redirection to 5GCN required\". In NB-S1 mode or WB-S1 mode via satellite E-UTRAN access, if the attach request is from a UE via a satellite E-UTRA cell and the network using the User Location Information provided by the eNodeB (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[23]), is able to determine that the UE is in a location where the network is not allowed to operate, the network shall set the EMM cause value in the ATTACH REJECT message to #78 \"PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE location\". Upon receiving the ATTACH REJECT message, if the message is integrity protected or contains a reject cause other than EMM cause value #25, the UE shall stop timer T3410.

Upon receiving the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message, if the message is integrity protected or contains a reject cause other than EMM cause value #25, the UE shall stop timer T3430 and stop any transmission of user data. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with EMM cause #25 was received without integrity protection, then the UE shall discard the message.

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status, 5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54] for the case when the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update performed over 3GPP access and indicating \"mobility registration updating\" in the 5GS registration type IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same value. #40\t(No EPS bearer context activated); The UE shall deactivate all the EPS bearer contexts locally, if any, and shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. If the rejected request was not for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, the UE shall perform a new attach procedure. NOTE\u00a07:\tUser interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot re-activate the EPS bearer(s) automatically. If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the GMM state as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13] for the case when the normal routing area updating procedure is rejected with the GMM cause value #10 \"Implicitly detached\". If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition set the 5GMM state to 5GMM-DEREGISTERED. #42\t(Severe network failure); The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED, and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list, eKSI, and list of equivalent PLMNs, and set the tracking area update counter to 5. The UE shall start an implementation specific timer, setting its value to 2 times the value of T as defined in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[6]. While this timer is running, the UE shall not consider the PLMN + RAT combination that provided this reject cause as a candidate for PLMN selection. The UE then enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[6]. If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition set the GMM state to GMM-DEREGISTERED, GPRS update status to GU2 NOT UPDATED, and shall delete the P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number. If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition set the 5GMM state to 5GMM-DEREGISTERED, 5GS update status to 5U2 NOT UPDATED, and shall delete any 5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI. #78\t(PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE location). This cause value received from a non-satellite E-UTRA cell is considered as an abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE is specified in clause\u00a05.5.3.2.6. The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to clause\u00a05.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. Additionally, the UE shall reset the registration attempt counter. The UE shall store the PLMN identity and, if it is known, the current geographical location in the list of \"PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location\", start a corresponding timer instance (see clause\u00a04.11.2), enter state EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH and perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[6]. If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status, and registration attempt counter as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54] for the case when the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update performed over 3GPP access and indicating \"mobility registration updating\" in the 5GS registration type IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same value. Other values are considered as abnormal cases. The specification of the UE behaviour in those cases is described in clause\u00a05.5.3.2.6. 5.5.3.2.5A\tTracking area updating procedure for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services not accepted by the network If the tracking area updating request for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services cannot be accepted by the network, the UE shall perform the procedures as described in clause\u00a05.5.3.2.5. Then if the UE is in the same selected PLMN where the last tracking area updating request was attempted, the UE shall: a)\tinform the upper layers of the failure of the procedure; or NOTE\u00a01:\tThis can result in the upper layers establishment of a CS emergency call (if not already attempted in the CS domain) or other implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.229\u00a0[13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to another IP-CAN. b)\tdetach locally, if not detached already, attempt EPS attach for emergency bearer services. If the tracking area updating request for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services fails due to abnormal case a) in clause\u00a05.5.3.2.6, the UE shall perform the actions as described in clause\u00a05.5.3.2.6 and inform the upper layers of the failure to access the network. NOTE\u00a02:\tThis can result in the upper layers establishment of a CS emergency call (if not already attempted in the CS domain) or other implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.229\u00a0[13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to another IP-CAN. If the tracking area updating request for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services fails due to abnormal cases b), c) or d) as well as k) when the \"Extended wait time\" is ignored, and ka) when the \"Extended wait time CP data\" is ignored in clause\u00a0.2.6, the UE shall perform the procedures as described in clause\u00a05.5.3.2.6. Then if the UE is in the same selected PLMN where the last tracking area updating request was attempted, the UE shall: a)\tinform the upper layers of the failure of the procedure; or NOTE\u00a03:\tThis can result in the upper layers establishment of a CS emergency call (if not already attempted in the CS domain) or other implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.229\u00a0[13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to another IP-CAN. b)\tdetach locally, if not detached already, attempt EPS attach for emergency bearer services. 5.5.3.2.5B\tTracking area updating for access to RLOS not accepted by the network If the tracking area updating request for access to RLOS cannot be accepted by the network, the UE shall perform the procedures as described in clause\u00a05.5.3.2.5 along with the following conditions: a)\tif the action for the reject involves searching for a suitable cell in E-UTRAN radio access technology, the UE shall proceed with the action and shall attempt to perform a tracking area updating procedure or an attach procedure for access to RLOS in the new tracking area, if found, depending on the EMM state. b)\tif the action for the reject involves attempting to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology or disabling the E-UTRAN capability, the UE shall skip the action for as long as access to RLOS is still needed. NOTE:\tHow long the UE attempts to access RLOS is up to UE implementation. Then if a)\tthe UE is in the same selected PLMN where the last tracking area updating procedure was attempted and rejected; b)\tthe tracking area updating procedure was rejected with an EMM cause value other than #9, #10 and #40; and c)\ttimer T3346 is not running, the UE shall: a)\tdetach locally, if not detached already, perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[6] to attempt EPS attach for access to RLOS via another PLMN. If the tracking area updating request for access to RLOS fails due to abnormal case a) in clause\u00a05.5.3.2.6, the UE shall perform the actions as described in clause\u00a05.5.3.2.6 and inform the upper layers of the failure to access the network.

The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. The attach procedure is started as soon as possible, i.e. when access for \"signalling\" is granted on the current cell or when the UE moves to a cell where access for \"signalling\" is granted. b)\tLower layer failure or release of the NAS signalling connection without \"Extended wait time\" received from lower layers before the ATTACH ACCEPT or ATTACH REJECT message is received. The attach procedure shall be aborted, and the UE shall proceed as described below. c)\tT3410 timeout The UE shall abort the attach procedure and proceed as described below. The NAS signalling connection shall be released locally. d)\tATTACH REJECT, other EMM cause values than those treated in subclause\u00a05.5.1.2.5, and cases of EMM cause #22, if considered as abnormal cases according to subclause\u00a05.5.1.2.5 Upon reception of the EMM cause #19 \"ESM failure\", if the UE is not configured for NAS signalling low priority, the UE may set the attach attempt counter to 5.

The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. The attach procedure is started as soon as possible, i.e. when access for \"originating signalling\" is granted on the current cell or when the UE moves to a cell where access for \"originating signalling\" is granted. In NB-S1 mode, if access is barred for \"originating signalling\" (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.331\u00a0[22]), the attach procedure shall not be started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. Further UE behaviour is implementation specific, e.g. the attach procedure is started again after an implementation dependent time. In NB-S1 mode, if access is barred for \"originating signalling\" (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.331\u00a0[22]), a request for an exceptional event is received from the upper layers, then the attach procedure shall be started. NOTE\u00a01:\tIn NB-S1 mode, the EMM layer cannot receive the access barring alleviation indication from the lower layers (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.331\u00a0[22]). If access is barred because of access class barring for \"originating signalling\" (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.331\u00a0[22]), ACDC is applicable to the request from the upper layers and the UE supports ACDC, then the attach procedure shall be started. If access is barred for a certain ACDC category (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.331\u00a0[22]), a request with a higher ACDC category is received from the upper layers and the UE supports ACDC, then the attach procedure shall be started. If an access request for an uncategorized application is barred due to ACDC (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.331\u00a0[22]), a request with a certain ACDC category is received from the upper layers and the UE supports ACDC, then the attach procedure shall be started. aa)\tLower layer failure to establish the RRC connection and: -\tthe UE is in its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present); -\tthe attach request is neither for emergency bearer services nor for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services with attach type not set to \"EPS emergency attach\"; -\tthe UE supports being configured with CustomLLFailureRetry as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A]); and -\tCustomLLFailureRetry leaf is present as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A]); The UE shall abort the attach procedure and wait for a UE implementation specific timer which shall be set to MinRetryTimer or MaxRetryTimer as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A]. The UE shall not set the UE implementation specific timer to MinRetryTimer for more than MaxMinRetry consecutive attempts as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A]. After the expiration of the UE implementation specific timer, the UE shall restart the attach procedure, if still needed. b)\tLower layer failure not covered in case aa) or release of the NAS signalling connection without \"Extended wait time\" and without \"Extended wait time CP data\" received from lower layers before the ATTACH ACCEPT or ATTACH REJECT message is received The attach procedure shall be aborted, and the UE shall proceed as described below. c)\tT3410 timeout The UE shall abort the attach procedure. The NAS signalling connection, if any, shall be released locally. NOTE\u00a02:\tThe NAS signalling connection can also be released if the UE deems that the network has failed the authentication check as specified in clause\u00a05.4.2.7.

Subsequently, if the UE needs to retransmit the ATTACH REQUEST message to request PDN connectivity towards a different APN, the UE may stop T3411 or T3402, if running, and send the ATTACH REQUEST message. If the UE needs to attempt EPS attach to request transfer of a PDN connection for emergency bearer services by including a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with request type set to \"handover of emergency bearer services\", the UE shall stop T3411 or T3402, if running, and send the ATTACH REQUEST message. NOTE\u00a03:\tWhen receiving EMM cause #19 \"ESM failure\", coordination is required between the EMM and ESM sublayers in the UE to determine whether to set the attach attempt counter to 5. If the attach request is neither for emergency bearer services nor for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services with attach type not set to \"EPS emergency attach\", upon reception of the EMM causes #95, #96, #97, #99 and #111 the UE should set the attach attempt counter to 5. The UE shall proceed as described below. e)\tChange of cell into a new tracking area If a cell change into a new tracking area occurs before the attach procedure is completed, the attach procedure shall be aborted and re-initiated immediately. If a tracking area border is crossed when the ATTACH ACCEPT message has been received but before an ATTACH COMPLETE message is sent, the attach procedure shall be re-initiated.

If the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message from the network in state EMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED and the detach type indicates \"re-attach required\", the detach procedure shall be progressed and the UE shall locally release the NAS signalling connection, before re-initiating the attach procedure. Otherwise the attach procedure shall be progressed and the DETACH REQUEST message shall be ignored. h)\tTransmission failure of ATTACH REQUEST message indication from lower layers The UE shall restart the attach procedure immediately. i)\tTransmission failure of ATTACH COMPLETE message indication from lower layers If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the UE shall restart the attach procedure. If the current TAI is still in the TAI list, it is up to the UE implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure. The EMM sublayer notifies the ESM sublayer that the ESM message in the ESM message container IE of the ATTACH COMPLETE has failed to be transmitted. j)\tIf EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, and the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message combined with the ATTACH ACCEPT is not accepted by the UE due to failure in the UE ESM sublayer, then the UE shall initiate the detach procedure by sending a DETACH REQUEST message to the network. Further UE behaviour is implementation specific. If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, and the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message combined with the ATTACH ACCEPT is not accepted by the UE due to failure in the UE ESM sublayer, then the UE shall either send an ATTACH COMPLETE message together with an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT contained in the ESM message container information element to the network or initiate the detach procedure by sending a DETACH REQUEST message. Further UE behaviour is implementation specific. k)\tIndication from the lower layers that an S101 mode to S1 mode handover has been cancelled (S101 mode only) The UE shall abort the attach procedure and enter state EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE. l)\t\"Extended wait time\" from the lower layers If the ATTACH REQUEST message contained the low priority indicator set to \"MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority\", the UE shall start timer T3346 with the \"Extended wait time\" value and reset the attach attempt counter. If the ATTACH REQUEST message did not contain the low priority indicator set to \"MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority\", the UE is operating in NB-S1 mode and the UE is not a UE configured to use AC11 \u2013 15 in selected PLMN, then the UE shall start timer T3346 with the \"Extended wait time\" value and reset the attach attempt counter. In other cases the UE shall ignore the \"Extended wait time\". The UE shall abort the attach procedure, stay in the current serving cell, change the state to EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH and apply the normal cell reselection process. The UE shall proceed as described below. la)\t\"Extended wait time CP data\" from the lower layers If the UE is operating in NB-S1 mode, the UE shall start the timer T3346 with the \"Extended wait time CP data\" value and reset the attach attempt counter. In other cases the UE shall ignore the \"Extended wait time CP data\". The UE shall abort the attach procedure, stay in the current serving cell, change the state to EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH and apply the normal cell reselection process.

The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. NOTE\u00a04:\tIt is considered an abnormal case if the UE needs to initiate an attach procedure while timer T3346 is running independent on whether timer T3346 was started due to an abnormal case or a non successful case. The UE shall proceed as described below. n)\tIf EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE is included in the ESM message container information element of the ATTACH REQUEST message and the UE receives the ATTACH ACCEPT message combined with a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message, the UE shall send an ATTACH COMPLETE message together with an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE contained in the ESM message container information element to the network.

    "text": "5.5.1.2.6A\tAbnormal cases in the UE, SMS services not accepted\t151 The following abnormal cases can be identified: a)\tAccess barred because of access class barring, EAB, ACDC or NAS signalling connection establishment rejected by the network without \"Extended wait time\" received from lower layers In WB-S1 mode, if access is barred for \"originating signalling\" (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.331\u00a0[22]), the attach procedure shall not be started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. The attach procedure is started as soon as possible, i.e. when access for \"originating signalling\" is granted on the current cell or when the UE moves to a cell where access for \"originating signalling\" is granted. In NB-S1 mode, if access is barred for \"originating signalling\" (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.331\u00a0[22]), the attach procedure shall not be started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. Further UE behaviour is implementation specific, e.g. the attach procedure is started again after an implementation dependent time. In NB-S1 mode, if access is barred for \"originating signalling\" (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.331\u00a0[22]), a request for an exceptional event is received from the upper layers, then the attach procedure shall be started. NOTE\u00a01:\tIn NB-S1 mode, the EMM layer cannot receive the access barring alleviation indication from the lower layers (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.331\u00a0[22]). If access is barred because of access class barring for \"originating signalling\" (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.331\u00a0[22]), ACDC is applicable to the request from the upper layers and the UE supports ACDC, then the attach procedure shall be started. If access is barred for a certain ACDC category (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.331\u00a0[22]), a request with a higher ACDC category is received from the upper layers and the UE supports ACDC, then the attach procedure shall be started. If an access request for an uncategorized application is barred due to ACDC (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.331\u00a0[22]), a request with a certain ACDC category is received from the upper layers and the UE supports ACDC, then the attach procedure shall be started. aa)\tLower layer failure to establish the RRC connection and: -\tthe UE is in its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present); -\tthe attach request is neither for emergency bearer services nor for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services with attach type not set to \"EPS emergency attach\"; -\tthe UE supports being configured with CustomLLFailureRetry as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A]); and -\tCustomLLFailureRetry leaf is present as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A]); The UE shall abort the attach procedure and wait for a UE implementation specific timer which shall be set to MinRetryTimer or MaxRetryTimer as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A]. The UE shall not set the UE implementation specific timer to MinRetryTimer for more than MaxMinRetry consecutive attempts as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A]. After the expiration of the UE implementation specific timer, the UE shall restart the attach procedure, if still needed. b)\tLower layer failure not covered in case aa) or release of the NAS signalling connection without \"Extended wait time\" and without \"Extended wait time CP data\" received from lower layers before the ATTACH ACCEPT or ATTACH REJECT message is received The attach procedure shall be aborted, and the UE shall proceed as described below. c)\tT3410 timeout The UE shall abort the attach procedure. The NAS signalling connection, if any, shall be released locally. NOTE\u00a02:\tThe NAS signalling connection can also be released if the UE deems that the network has failed the authentication check as specified in clause\u00a05.4.2.7. The UE shall proceed as described below. d)\tATTACH REJECT, other EMM cause values than those treated in clause\u00a05.5.1.2.5, and cases of EMM cause values #22, #25, #31 and #78, if considered as abnormal cases according to clause\u00a05.5.1.2.5 Upon reception of the EMM cause #19 \"ESM failure\", if the UE is not configured for NAS signalling low priority and the ESM cause value received in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message is not #54 \"PDN connection does not exist\", the UE may set the attach attempt counter to 5. Subsequently, if the UE needs to retransmit the ATTACH REQUEST message to request PDN connectivity towards a different APN, the UE may stop T3411 or T3402, if running, and send the ATTACH REQUEST message. If the UE needs to attempt EPS attach to request transfer of a PDN connection for emergency bearer services by including a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with request type set to \"handover of emergency bearer services\", the UE shall stop T3411 or T3402, if running, and send the ATTACH REQUEST message. NOTE\u00a03:\tWhen receiving EMM cause #19 \"ESM failure\", coordination is required between the EMM and ESM sublayers in the UE to determine whether to set the attach attempt counter to 5. If the attach request is neither for emergency bearer services nor for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services with attach type not set to \"EPS emergency attach\", upon reception of the EMM causes #95, #96, #97, #99 and #111 the UE should set the attach attempt counter to 5. The UE shall proceed as described below. e)\tChange of cell into a new tracking area If a cell change into a new tracking area occurs before the attach procedure is completed, the attach procedure shall be aborted and re-initiated immediately. If a tracking area border is crossed when the ATTACH ACCEPT message has been received but before an ATTACH COMPLETE message is sent, the attach procedure shall be re-initiated. If a GUTI was allocated during the attach procedure, this GUTI shall be used in the attach procedure. f)\tMobile originated detach required The attach procedure shall be aborted, and the UE initiated detach procedure shall be performed. g)\tDetach procedure collision If the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message from the network in state EMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED and the detach type indicates \"re-attach not required\" and no EMM cause IE, or \"re-attach not required\" and the EMM cause value is not #2 \"IMSI unknown in HSS\", the detach procedure shall be progressed and the attach procedure shall be aborted. If the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message from the network in state EMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED and the detach type indicates \"re-attach required\", the detach procedure shall be progressed and the UE shall locally release the NAS signalling connection, before re-initiating the attach procedure. Otherwise the attach procedure shall be progressed and the DETACH REQUEST message shall be ignored. h)\tTransmission failure of ATTACH REQUEST message indication from lower layers The UE shall restart the attach procedure immediately. i)\tTransmission failure of ATTACH COMPLETE message indication from lower layers If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the UE shall restart the attach procedure. If the current TAI is still in the TAI list, it is up to the UE implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure. The EMM sublayer notifies the ESM sublayer that the ESM message in the ESM message container IE of the ATTACH COMPLETE has failed to be transmitted. j)\tIf EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, and the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message combined with the ATTACH ACCEPT is not accepted by the UE due to failure in the UE ESM sublayer, then the UE shall initiate the detach procedure by sending a DETACH REQUEST message to the network. Further UE behaviour is implementation specific. If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, and the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message combined with the ATTACH ACCEPT is not accepted by the UE due to failure in the UE ESM sublayer, then the UE shall either send an ATTACH COMPLETE message together with an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT contained in the ESM message container information element to the network or initiate the detach procedure by sending a DETACH REQUEST message. Further UE behaviour is implementation specific. k)\tIndication from the lower layers that an S101 mode to S1 mode handover has been cancelled (S101 mode only) The UE shall abort the attach procedure and enter state EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE. l)\t\"Extended wait time\" from the lower layers If the ATTACH REQUEST message contained the low priority indicator set to \"MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority\", the UE shall start timer T3346 with the \"Extended wait time\" value and reset the attach attempt counter. If the ATTACH REQUEST message did not contain the low priority indicator set to \"MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority\", the UE is operating in NB-S1 mode and the UE is not a UE configured to use AC11 \u2013 15 in selected PLMN, then the UE shall start timer T3346 with the \"Extended wait time\" value and reset the attach attempt counter. In other cases the UE shall ignore the \"Extended wait time\". The UE shall abort the attach procedure, stay in the current serving cell, change the state to EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH and apply the normal cell reselection process. The UE shall proceed as described below. la)\t\"Extended wait time CP data\" from the lower layers If the UE is operating in NB-S1 mode, the UE shall start the timer T3346 with the \"Extended wait time CP data\" value and reset the attach attempt counter. In other cases the UE shall ignore the \"Extended wait time CP data\". The UE shall abort the attach procedure, stay in the current serving cell, change the state to EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH and apply the normal cell reselection process.

The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. NOTE\u00a04:\tIt is considered an abnormal case if the UE needs to initiate an attach procedure while timer T3346 is running independent on whether timer T3346 was started due to an abnormal case or a non successful case. The UE shall proceed as described below. n)\tIf EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE is included in the ESM message container information element of the ATTACH REQUEST message and the UE receives the ATTACH ACCEPT message combined with a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message, the UE shall send an ATTACH COMPLETE message together with an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE contained in the ESM message container information element to the network. Further UE behaviour is implementation specific. o)\tTimer T3447 is running The UE shall not start the attach procedure unless: -\tthe UE is a UE configured to use AC11 \u2013 15 in selected PLMN; -\tthe UE attempts to attach for emergency bearer services; or -\tthe UE attempts to attach without PDN connection request.

The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process. NOTE\u00a04:\tIt is considered an abnormal case if the UE needs to initiate a tracking area updating procedure while timer T3346 is running independent on whether timer T3346 was started due to an abnormal case or a non successful case. If the TAI of the current serving cell is not included in the TAI list or the TIN indicates \"P-TMSI\", the UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and change to state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE. If the tracking area updating procedure needs to be initiated for an MO MMTEL voice call or an MO MMTEL video call is started, then a notification that the procedure was not initiated due to network congestion shall be provided to upper layers. NOTE\u00a05:\tThis can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of the originating voice call on an alternative manner e.g. requesting establishment of a CS voice call (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.173\u00a0[13E]). The UE shall proceed as described below. la)\tTimer T3448 is running The UE shall not start the tracking area updating procedure with the \"signalling active\" flag set, unless: -\tthe UE is a UE configured to use AC11 \u2013 15 in selected PLMN; -\tthe UE which is only using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization received a paging; or -\tthe UE in NB-S1 mode is requested by the upper layer to transmit user data related to an exceptional event and the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting (see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the NAS configuration MO in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A] or the USIM file EFNASCONFIG in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]).

If timer T3411 expires the tracking area updating procedure is triggered again. If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5, and the TAI of the current serving cell is not included in the TAI list or the EPS update status is different to EU1 UPDATED or the TIN indicates \"P-TMSI\" or the tracking area updating procedure is performed due to an inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode or if the tracking area updating procedure is performed due to cases g, m, n, za, zc in clause 5.5.3.2.2: -\tfor the cases k and l, the tracking area updating procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is stopped. -\tfor the case ka, if timer T3346 is started, the tracking area updating procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is stopped. -\tfor the case ka, if timer T3448 is started and the \"signalling active\" flag is set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the tracking area updating procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3448 expires or is stopped. -\tfor the case la, if the \"signalling active\" flag is set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the tracking area updating procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3448 expires or is stopped. -\tfor the cases b, c, d, k when the \"Extended wait time\" is ignored, and ka when the \"Extended wait time CP data\" is ignored, if the tracking area updating request is not for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, the UE shall start timer T3411, shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and change to state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE. When timer T3411 expires the tracking area updating procedure is triggered again. If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition handle the GPRS update status as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13] for the abnormal case when a normal or periodic routing area updating procedure fails and the routing area updating attempt counter is less than 5 and the GPRS update status is different from GU1 UPDATED. If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GS update status as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54] for the abnormal cases when a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration fails and the registration attempt counter is less than 5 and the 5GS update status is different from 5U1 UPDATED.

NOTE\u00a01:\tIf the network pages the UE due to downlink signalling pending, the network initiates the release of the NAS signalling connection after network-requested procedure is completed. For the UE using eDRX, the network initiates the paging procedure when NAS signalling messages, cdma2000\u00ae signalling messages or user data is pending to be sent to the UE within the paging time window. If NAS signalling messages, cdma2000\u00ae signalling messages or user data is pending to be sent to the UE outside the paging time window and the eDRX value that the network provides to the UE in the Extended DRX parameters IE during the last attach procedure or the last tracking area updating procedure is not all zeros (i.e. the E-UTRAN eDRX cycle length duration is higher than 5.12 seconds), the network initiates the paging procedure at T time ahead of the beginning of the next paging time window. NOTE\u00a02:\tT time is a short time period based on implementation. The operator can take possible imperfections in the synchronization between the CN and the UE into account when choosing T time. Figure 5.6.2.2.1.1: Paging procedure using S-TMSI To initiate the procedure the EMM entity in the network requests the lower layer to start paging (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[20], 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[23]) and shall start the timer: -\tT3415 for this paging procedure, if the network accepted to use eDRX for the UE and the UE does not have a PDN connection for emergency bearer services. -\tOtherwise, T3413 for this paging procedure. If the network detects that the pending user data to be sent to the UE is related to the voice service as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[7] and the network decides to initiate the paging procedure based on the stored paging restriction information, if any, the EMM entity in the network should request the lower layer to include the Voice Service Indication in the Paging message when the UE and the network support the paging indication for voice services. If the network starts timer T3415, the network shall set timer T3415 to a value smaller than the value of timer T3-RESPONSE (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.274\u00a0[16D] for further details on timer T3-RESPONSE). The EMM entity may provide the lower layer with a list of CSG IDs, including the CSG IDs of both the expired and the not expired subscriptions. If there is a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the EMM entity in the network shall not provide the list of CSG IDs to the lower layer. If the negotiated UE paging probability information is available in the EMM context of the UE, the EMM entity shall provide the lower layer with the negotiated UE paging probability information (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[20], 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[23]). Upon reception of a paging indication, if control plane CIoT EPS optimization is not used by the UE, the UE shall stop the timer T3346, if running, and shall initiate: -\ta service request procedure to respond to the paging (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10] and 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[23]); or -\ta tracking area updating procedure as specified in clauses\u00a05.5.3.2.2 and 5.5.3.3.2. and additionally if the UE is in the EMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication, resume the suspended NAS signalling connection to the MME as specified in clause\u00a05.3.1.3. Upon reception of a paging indication, if control plane CIoT EPS optimization is used by the UE, the UE shall stop the timer T3346, if running, and shall additionally: -\tinitiate a service request procedure as specified in clause\u00a05.6.1.2.2 if the UE is in the EMM-IDLE mode without suspend indication; -\tinitiate a tracking area updating procedure as specified in clauses\u00a05.5.3.2.2; or -\tproceed the behaviour as specified in clause\u00a05.3.1.3 if the UE is in the EMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication. NOTE\u00a03:\tIf the UE is in the EMM-IDLE mode without suspend indication and has an uplink user data to be sent to the network using control plane CIoT EPS optimization when receiving the paging indication, the UE can piggyback the uplink user data during the service request procedure initiated to respond to the paging, as specified in clause\u00a05.6.1.2.2. Upon reception of a paging indication, if the network supports the reject paging request and the MUSIM UE decides not to accept the paging, the UE may initiate a service request procedure to reject the paging as specified in clause\u00a05.6.1.1. NOTE\u00a04:\tAs an implementation option, the MUSIM UE is allowed to not respond to paging based on the information available in the paging message, e.g. voice service indication. If the paging for EPS services was received during an ongoing UE-initiated EMM specific procedure or service request procedure, then the UE shall ignore the paging. The network shall proceed with the EMM specific procedure or the service request procedure, and stop the timer for the paging procedure (i.e. either timer T3413 or timer T3415). If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message when the paging procedure is ongoing, it should be considered as an abnormal case, and the behaviour of the network for this case is specified in clause\u00a05.6.2.2.1.2. The network shall stop the timer for the paging procedure (i.e. either timer T3413 or timer T3415) when an integrity-protected response is received from the UE and successfully integrity checked by the network or when the EMM entity in the MME receives an indication from the lower layer that it has received the S1-AP UE context resume request message as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.413\u00a0[23]. If the response received is not integrity protected, or the integrity check is unsuccessful, the timer for the paging procedure (i.e. either timer T3413 or timer T3415) shall be kept running unless: -\tthe UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services; or -\tthe response received is a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the security mode control procedure or authentication procedure performed during tracking area updating procedure has completed successfully. Upon expiry of timer T3413, the network may reinitiate paging. If the network, while waiting for a response to the paging sent without paging priority, receives downlink signalling or downlink data associated with priority EPS bearers, the network shall stop the timer for the paging procedure (i.e. either timer T3413 or timer T3415), and then initiate the paging procedure with paging priority. Upon expiry of timer T3415, the network shall abort the paging procedure and shall proceed as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10].",

    "text": "The UE may be rejected with EMM cause #78 in ATTACH REJECT message, TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message or DETACH REQUEST message. The EMM cause #78 is applicable for the UE only when the UE is accessing a PLMN using a satellite E-UTRAN access. For the satellite E-UTRAN access the UE shall store a list of \"PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE location\". Each entry in the list consists of: a)\tPLMN identity of the PLMN which sent a message including EMM cause value #78 \"PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE location\" via the satellite E-UTRAN access technology; b)\tgeographical location, if known by the UE, where the EMM cause value #78 was received over the satellite E-UTRAN access technology; and c)\tif the geographical location exists, a UE implementation specific distance value. Before storing a new entry in the list, the UE shall delete any existing entry with the same PLMN identity. Upon storing a new entry, the UE starts a timer instance associated with the entry with an implementation specific value that shall not be set to a value smaller than the timer value indicated by the network in the Lower bound timer value IE, if any. If the Lower bound timer value IE was not provided by the network, the value of the timer shall be set based on the UE implementation. The UE is allowed to attempt to access a PLMN via the satellite E-UTRAN access technology which is part of the list of \"PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location\" if: a)\tthe current UE location is known, a geographical location is stored for the entry of this PLMN, and the distance from location where EMM cause value #78 was received to the current UE location is larger than a UE implementation specific value: b)\tthe timer associated with the entry of this PLMN has expired; or c)\tthe access is for emergency services (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[5] for further details). NOTE:\tWhen the UE is accessing network for emergency services, it is up to operator and regulatory policies whether the network needs to determine if the UE is in a location where network is not allowed to operate. The list shall accommodate three or more entries. The maximum number of entries is an implementation decision. When the list is full and a new entry has to be inserted, the oldest entry shall be deleted. Each entry shall be removed if for the entry: a)\tthe UE successfully registers via the satellite E-UTRAN access technology to the PLMN stored in the entry except when the UE is attached for emergency bearer services; or b)\tthe timer instance associated with the entry expires. The UE may remove an entry in the list, if the UE's current location is known, a geographical is stored for the entry of this PLMN, and the distance from location where EMM cause value #78 was received to the current UE location is larger than the UE implementation specific value. If the UE is in EMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE state and an entry from the list of \"PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location\" is removed, the UE shall perform PLMN selection according to 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[6]. When the UE is switched off, the UE shall keep the list of \"PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location\" in its non-volatile memory together with the SUPI from the USIM. The UE shall delete the list of \"PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location\" if the USIM is removed. If the UE is switched off when the timer instance associated with the entry in the list is running, the UE shall behave as follows when the UE is switched on and the USIM in the UE remains the same: let t1 be the time remaining for timer instance associated with the entry in the list to timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1\u00a0\u2013\u00a0t. If t1 is equal to or less than t, then the timer need not be restarted and considered expired. If the UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer with the value t1.",

If the MME accepts the request, all SGi PDN connections are considered as established without Control plane only indication. NOTE\u00a03:\tIn this release of the specification, a UE in NB-S1 mode can support a maximum of 2 user plane radio bearers (see clause\u00a06.5.0). For case c in clause\u00a05.6.1.1, upon receipt of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message with Control plane service type indicating \"mobile originating request\" and without an ESM message container IE, after completion of the EMM common procedures according to clause\u00a05.6.1.3, if any, the MME proceeds as follows: If the MME needs to perform an EPS bearer context status synchronization -\tfor an EPS bearer context associated with Control plane only indication; or -\tfor an EPS bearer context not associated with Control plane only indication, and there is no downlink user data pending to be delivered via the user plane, then the MME shall send a SERVICE ACCEPT message. Furthermore, the MME may: 1)\tinitiate the setup of the user plane radio bearer(s), if downlink user data is pending to be delivered via the user plane; 2)\tsend an ESM DATA TRANSPORT message to the UE, if downlink user data is pending to be delivered via the control plane; 3)\tsend a NAS signalling message not related to an EMM common procedure to the UE, if downlink signalling is pending; or 4)\tsend a SERVICE ACCEPT message to complete the service request procedure, if no NAS security mode control procedure was initiated, the MME did not send a SERVICE ACCEPT message as specified above to perform an EPS bearer context status synchronization, and the MME did not initiate any of the procedures specified in item 1 to 3 above. If the MUSIM UE does not include the Paging restriction IE in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message, the MME shall delete any stored paging restriction for the UE and stop restricting paging. For cases p and q in clause\u00a05.6.1.1 when the MUSIM UE sets the Request type to \"NAS signalling connection release\" or to \"Rejection of paging\" in the UE request type IE in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message and if the UE requests restriction of paging by including the Paging restriction IE, the MME: -\tif accepts the paging restriction, shall include the EPS additional request result IE in the SERVICE ACCEPT message and set the Paging restriction decision to \"paging restriction is accepted\". The MME shall store the paging restriction of the UE, enforce these restrictions in the paging procedure as described in clause\u00a05.6.2; or -\tif rejects the paging restriction, shall include the EPS additional request result IE in the SERVICE ACCEPT message and set the Paging restriction decision to \"paging restriction is rejected\", and shall discard the received paging restriction. The MME shall delete any stored paging restriction for the UE and stop restricting paging; and -\tshall initiate the release of the NAS signalling connection after the completion of the service request procedure. In NB-S1 mode, for cases a, b, c and m in clause\u00a05.6.1.1, if the MME needs to initiate the setup of user plane radio bearer(s), the MME shall check if the UE can support the establishment of additional user plane radio bearer based on the multiple DRB support indicated by UE in the UE network capability IE. For cases a, b and c in clause 5.6.1.1, if the EPS bearer context status IE is included in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message, the network shall deactivate all those EPS bearer contexts locally (without peer-to-peer signalling between the network and the UE) which are active on the network side but are indicated by the UE as being inactive. If a default EPS bearer context is marked as inactive in the EPS bearer context status IE included in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message, and this default bearer is not associated with the last PDN connection of the UE in the MME, the MME shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE. If the default bearer is associated with the last remaining PDN connection of the UE in the MME, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the MME shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE. If the EPS bearer context status IE is included in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST and the MME decides to respond with a SERVICE ACCEPT message, the MME shall include an EPS bearer context status IE, indicating which EPS bearer contexts are active in the MME, except for the case when no EPS bearer context exists on the network side. If the MME needs to initiate an EPS bearer context status synchronization, the MME may include an EPS bearer context status IE in the SERVICE ACCEPT message also if no EPS bearer context status IE was included in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message. If the MME sends a SERVICE ACCEPT message upon receipt of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message piggybacked with the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message: -\tif the Release assistance indication IE is set to \"No further uplink and no further downlink data transmission subsequent to the uplink data transmission is expected\" in the message; -\tif the UE has indicated support for the control plane data back-off timer; and -\tif the MME decides to activate the congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane, then the MME shall include the T3448 value IE in the SERVICE ACCEPT message. If the MME sends a SERVICE ACCEPT message and decides to deactivate congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane then the MME shall delete the stored control plane data back-off time for the UE and the MME shall not include timer T3448 value IE in SERVICE ACCEPT message. For cases a, b, c and m in clause 5.6.1.1, if the EPS bearer context status IE is included in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message or the MME needs to initiate an EPS bearer context status synchronization, the MME shall consider the service request procedure successfully completed when it sends the SERVICE ACCEPT message. If the EPS bearer context status IE is not included in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message and the MME does not need to initiate an EPS bearer context status synchronization, the MME shall consider the service request procedure successfully completed in the following cases: -\twhen it successfully completes a NAS security mode control procedure; -\twhen it receives an indication from the lower layer that the user plane is setup, if radio bearer establishment is required; -\tupon receipt of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message and completion of the EMM common procedures, if any, if the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message was successfully integrity checked and the ESM message container or NAS message container in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message, if applicable, was successfully deciphered, radio bearer establishment is not required, and the MME has downlink user data or signalling not related to an EMM common procedure pending; and -\twith the transmission of a SERVICE ACCEPT message or with the decision to initiate release of the NAS signalling connection, if the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message was successfully integrity checked and the ESM message container or NAS message container in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message, if applicable, was successfully deciphered, radio bearer establishment is not required, and the MME does not have any downlink user data or signalling pending. If the MME considers the service request procedure successfully completed the MME shall: 1)\tforward the contents of the ESM message container IE, if any, to the ESM layer; and 2)\tforward the contents of the NAS message container IE, if any. For cases a, b and c in clause\u00a05.6.1.1, the UE shall treat the receipt of any of the following as successful completion of the procedure: -\ta SECURITY MODE COMMAND message; -\ta security protected EMM message different from a SERVICE REJECT message and not related to an EMM common procedure; -\ta security protected ESM message; and -\treceipt of the indication from the lower layers that the user plane radio bearers are set up. Upon successful completion of the procedure, the UE shall reset the service request attempt counter, stop the timer T3417 and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED. NOTE\u00a04:\tThe security protected EMM message can be e.g. a SERVICE ACCEPT message and the ESM message an ESM DATA TRANSPORT message. For case m in clause\u00a05.6.1.1, the UE shall treat the indication from the lower layers that the user plane radio bearers are set up as successful completion of the procedure. The UE shall treat the receipt of a SERVICE ACCEPT message as completion of the procedure without the establishment of the user plane radio bearers. For both cases, the UE shall reset the service request attempt counter, stop the timer T3417 and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED. For case b in clause\u00a05.6.1.1, the UE shall also treat the indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection has been released as successful completion of the procedure. The UE shall reset the service request attempt counter, stop the timer T3417 and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED. For cases a, c and m in clause\u00a05.6.1.1, the UE shall treat the indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection has been released as an abnormal case and shall follow the procedure described in clause\u00a05.6.1.6, item b. For cases p and q in clause\u00a05.6.1.1, when the MUSIM UE in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message sets the Request type to \"NAS signalling connection release\" or to \"Rejection of paging\" in the UE request type IE, the UE shall treat the receipt of SERVICE ACCEPT message as the successful completion of the procedure and the UE shall reset the service request attempt counter, stop timer T3417, enter the state EMM-REGISTERED and not deactivate EPS bearer contexts locally. For case o in clause\u00a05.6.1.1, the UE shall treat the receipt of SERVICE ACCEPT message as the successful completion of the procedure. The UE shall reset the service request attempt counter, stop timer T3417 and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED. For cases a, b and c in clause 5.6.1.1, -\tif the MME needs to initiate an EPS bearer context status synchronization or to provide the UE with Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" IE or Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\", the UE can receive a SERVICE ACCEPT message even after it received a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message or an indication from the lower layers that the user plane radio bearers are set up and determined successful completion of the service request procedure. Upon receipt of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message or an indication from the lower layers that the user plane radio bearers are set up, the UE shall start timer T3449. If the UE receives a security protected ESM message or a security protected EMM message not related to an EMM common procedure, the UE shall stop the timer T3449. If the UE receives a SERVICE ACCEPT message while the timer T3449 is running, the UE shall treat the SERVICE ACCEPT message and stop the timer T3449. If the UE is not in state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED and timer T3449 is not running, the receipt of the SERVICE ACCEPT message is considered as protocol error and the UE shall return EMM STATUS message as specified in clause 7.4; otherwise the UE shall treat the SERVICE ACCEPT message; and -\tif the UE treats the SERVICE ACCEPT message and an EPS bearer context status IE is included in the message, the UE shall deactivate all those EPS bearers contexts locally (without peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the MME) which are active in the UE, but are indicated by the MME as being inactive. If a default EPS bearer context is marked as inactive in the EPS bearer context status IE included in the SERVICE ACCEPT message, and this default bearer is not associated with the last remaining PDN connection in the UE, the UE shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the MME. If the default bearer is associated with the last remaining PDN connection of the UE in the MME, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the UE shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the MME. If the T3448 value IE is present in the received SERVICE ACCEPT message, the UE shall: -\tstop timer T3448 if it is running; -\tconsider the transport of user data via the control plane as successful; and -\tstart timer T3448 with the value provided in the T3448 value IE. If the UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization, the T3448 value IE is present in the SERVICE ACCEPT message and the value indicates that this timer is either zero or deactivated, the UE shall consider this case as an abnormal case and proceed as if the T3448 value IE is not present. If the UE in EMM-IDLE mode initiated the service request procedure by sending a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message and the SERVICE ACCEPT message does not include the T3448 value IE and if timer T3448 is running, then the UE shall stop timer T3448. If the MME received the list of TAIs from the satellite E-UTRAN as described in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10], and determines that, by UE subscription and operator's preference, any but not all TAIs in the received list of TAIs is forbidden for roaming or for regional provision of service, the MME shall include the TAI(s) in: a) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" IE; b) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\" IE; or c)\tboth, in the SERVICE ACCEPT message. If the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" IE in the SERVICE ACCEPT message and the TAI(s) included in the IE is not part of the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\", the UE shall store the TAI(s) included in the IE into the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\". If the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\" IE in the SERVICE ACCEPT message and the TAI(s) included in the IE is not part of the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\", the UE shall store the TAI(s) included in the IE into the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service\".",

The length of the value part of the User data container IE should not exceed the link MTU size for the respective type of user data (IPv4, IPv6 or Non-IP). If the user data in the value part of the User data container IE is an Ethernet frame, then the length of the Ethernet frame payload should not exceed the Ethernet frame payload MTU size. NOTE:\tThe recommended maximum size for link MTU is 1358 octets to prevent fragmentation in the backbone network (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.060\u00a0[74]). Depending on the network configuration, setting link MTU size to a value larger than 1358 octets could lead to inefficient core network implementation due to fragmentation. If the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode, the UE initiates the procedure by sending the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message included in a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message. Based on information provided by the upper layers, the UE may include a Release assistance indication IE in the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message to inform the network that 1)\tsubsequent to the current uplink data transmission no further uplink or downlink data transmission (e.g. an acknowledgement or response) is expected; i.e. the upper layers indicated that data exchanges have completed with the current UL data transfer; or 2)\tsubsequent to the current uplink data transmission only a single downlink data transmission and no further uplink data transmission is expected; i.e. the upper layers indicated that data exchanges will have completed with the next downlink data transmission.

    "text": "CIoT EPS optimizations provide improved support of small data and SMS transfer. A UE supporting CIoT EPS optimizations can indicate the CIoT network behaviour the UE can support and prefers to use during attach or tracking area updating procedure (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10]). The UE may indicate the support for control plane CIoT EPS optimization, user plane CIoT EPS optimization, EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection, S1-U data transfer and header compression (see clause\u00a09.9.3.34). The UE may also request to use SMS transfer without combined attach procedure during the attach procedure. Furthermore, the UE may, separately from the indication of support, indicate preference for control plane CIoT EPS optimization or user plane CIoT EPS optimization (see clause\u00a09.9.3.0B). The indication of preference is also considered as the request to use. A UE supporting CIoT 5GS optimizations can also indicate the 5GS CIoT network behaviour the UE can support during attach or tracking area updating procedure. Furthermore, the UE may, separately from the indication of support, indicate preference for control plane CIoT 5GS optimization or user plane CIoT 5GS optimization. NOTE\u00a01:\tThe UE supporting control plane CIoT EPS optimization and S1-U data transfer but not user plane CIoT EPS optimization does not indicate preference for user plane CIoT EPS optimization. The UE can be in NB-S1 mode or WB-S1 mode when requesting the use of CIoT EPS optimizations during an attach or tracking area updating procedure. A UE in NB-S1 mode always indicates support for control plane CIoT EPS optimization. A UE in NB-S1 mode can also request SMS transfer without combined procedure by using the normal attach or tracking area updating procedure (see clause\u00a05.5.1 and 5.5.3). In NB-S1 mode, the UE, when requesting the use of CIoT EPS optimization, does not: -\trequest an attach for emergency bearer services procedure; -\trequest an attach procedure for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services with attach type not set to \"EPS emergency attach\"; -\tindicate voice domain preference and UE's usage setting; or -\trequest an attach for access to RLOS. The network does not indicate to the UE support of emergency bearer services when the UE is in NB-S1 mode (see clause\u00a05.5.1.2.4 and 5.5.3.2.4). The control plane CIoT EPS optimization enables support of efficient transport of user data (IP, non-IP, Ethernet) or SMS messages over control plane via the MME without triggering data radio bearer establishment. The support of control plane CIoT EPS optimization is mandatory for the network in NB-S1 mode and optional in WB-S1 mode. Optional header compression of IP data can be applied to IP PDN type PDN connections that are configured to support header compression. The user plane CIoT EPS optimization enables support for change from EMM-IDLE mode to EMM-CONNECTED mode without the need for using the service request procedure (see clause\u00a05.3.1.3). If the UE indicates support of EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection in the attach request, the UE may include an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE instead of a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message as part of the attach procedure. If the EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the network, the UE and the network can at any time release all the PDN connections and the UE still remains EPS attached. NOTE\u00a02:\tFor both the UE and the network, the term \"EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection\" is equivalent to the term \"EPS attach without PDN connectivity\" as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10]. In NB-S1 mode, if the UE indicates \"SMS only\" during a normal attach or tracking area updating procedure, the MME supporting CIoT EPS optimisations provides SMS so that the UE is not required to perform a combined attach or tracking area updating procedure. If the UE supports user plane CIoT EPS optimization, it shall also support S1-U data transfer. If the UE indicates support of one or more CIoT EPS optimizations and the network supports one or more CIoT EPS optimizations and decides to accept the attach or tracking area update request, the network indicates the supported CIoT EPS optimizations to the UE per TAI list when accepting the UE request. Network indication of support is interpreted by the UE as the acceptance to use the respective feature. After completion of the attach or tracking area updating procedure, the UE and the network can then use the accepted CIoT EPS optimizations for the transfer of user data (IP, non-IP, Ethernet and SMS). The UE supporting control plane CIoT EPS optimization may indicate support for control plane MT-EDT during the attach or tracking area updating procedure. For a UE that supports control plane MT-EDT and for which the network has accepted the use of control plane CIoT EPS optimization, the network may trigger the delivery of downlink data to the UE, when available, using procedures for control plane MT-EDT as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10]. The UE supporting user plane CIoT EPS optimization may indicate support for user plane MT-EDT during the attach or tracking area updating procedure. For a UE that supports user plane MT-EDT and for which the network has accepted the use of user plane CIoT EPS optimization, the network may trigger the delivery of downlink data to the UE, when available, using procedures for user plane MT-EDT as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10]. If the UE and the network support both the control plane CIoT EPS optimization and S1-U data transfer, then when receiving the UE's request for a PDN connection, the MME decides whether the PDN connection should be SCEF PDN connection or SGi PDN connection as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10]: -\tif SCEF PDN connection is to be established for non-IP data type, the MME shall include Control plane only indication for the requested PDN connection; -\tif SGi PDN connection is to be established and existing SGi PDN connections for this UE were established with Control plane only indication, the MME shall include Control plane only indication for the newly requested SGi PDN connection; -\tif SGi PDN connection is to be established and existing SGi PDN connections for this UE were established without Control plane only indication, the MME shall not include Control plane only indication for the newly requested SGi PDN connection; and -\tif SGi PDN connection is to be established and no SGi PDN connection for this UE exists, the MME determine whether to include Control plane only indication for the requested SGi PDN connection based on local policies, the UE's preferred CIoT network behaviour and the supported CIoT network behaviour. If the network supports user plane CIoT EPS optimization, it shall also support S1-U data transfer. Broadcast system information may provide information about support of CIoT EPS optimizations (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.331\u00a0[22]). At reception of new broadcast system information, the lower layers deliver it to the EMM layer in the UE. The information provided by lower layers is per PLMN and used by the UE to determine whether certain CIoT EPS optimizations are supported in the cell. The UE shall not attempt to use CIoT EPS optimizations which are indicated as not supported. In NB-S1 mode, when the UE requests the lower layer to establish a RRC connection and the UE requests the use of EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection or user plane CIoT EPS optimization, the UE shall pass an indication of the requested CIoT EPS optimizations to the lower layers. If the UE requests the use of S1-U data transfer without user plane CIoT optimization, then the UE shall also pass an indication of user plane CIoT EPS optimization to lower layers. In WB-S1 mode, when the UE requests the lower layer to establish a RRC connection and the UE requests the use of EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection, control plane CIoT EPS optimization or user plane CIoT EPS optimization, the UE shall pass an indication of the requested CIoT EPS optimizations to the lower layers.",

NOTE\u00a01:\tClauses\u00a06.5.1.4 and 6.5.3.4 specify how the UE determines the PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode. In earlier versions of the protocol, the maximum number of simultaneously active EPS bearer contexts was limited by lower layer protocols to 8. In the present version of the protocol, the UE and the network may support a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts. A UE supporting signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts shall support the extended range or EPS bearer identities from 0 to 15 (as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.007\u00a0[12] clause\u00a011.2.3.1.5). The UE indicates support of signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts by setting the 15 bearers bit in the UE Network Capability IE. A network supporting signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts shall support the extended range or EPS bearer identities from 0 to 15 (as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.007\u00a0[12] clause\u00a011.2.3.1.5). The network indicates support of signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts by setting the 15 bearers bit in the EPS network feature support IE. NOTE\u00a02:\tA UE and a network not supporting signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts will treat the EPS bearer identity values 1 to 4 as 'reserved' values. For a UE in NB-S1 mode, the UE's implementation-specific maximum number of active user plane radio bearers is 2 (as defined in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[20]) when the UE sets the Multiple DRB support bit to \"Multiple DRB supported\" during attach or tracking area updating procedures, and 1 otherwise. Upon an inter-system change from N1 mode to NB-S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode for the UE operating in single-registration mode, if: a)\tthe number of active default EPS bearer contexts in the UE is larger than the UE's implementation-specific maximum number of active user plane radio bearers; and b)\tthe UE is using user plane CIoT EPS optimization; the UE shall locally deactivate at least one default EPS bearer context such that the total number of active default EPS bearer contexts that remained does not exceed the UE's implementation-specific maximum number of active user plane radio bearers. In this case, choosing which EPS bearer context to deactivate is implementation specific. The UE shall then include the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. Upon the inter-system change from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode, for any PDN connection that has been transferred, if the PDN connection is not associated with a PDU session ID and the UE supporting N1 mode decides to enable the transfer of the PDN connection from S1 mode to N1 mode, the UE may first initiate the UE requested PDN disconnection procedure and then the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure for such PDN connection(s). As an implementation option, the UE may deactivate all EPS bearer contexts for such PDN connection(s) locally, include the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message of the tracking area updating procedure upon inter-system change from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode, and then initiate UE requested PDN connectivity procedure for such PDN connection(s). NOTE\u00a03:\tUpon the inter-system change from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode, if a PDN connection does not support interworking with 5GS and the UE determines that the PLMN or the APN cannot support interworking with 5GS, it is recommended that a UE does not release and re-establish the PDN connection in order to enable interworking with 5GS for the PDN connection. Whether and how the UE determines the PLMN or the APN can support interworking with 5GS is implementation specific.",

In cases b and c, -\tupon an indication from the lower layers that the user plane radio bearers are set up, the UE shall stop timer T3440 and may send uplink signalling via the existing NAS signalling connection or user data via the user plane bearers; or -\tupon receipt of a DETACH REQUEST message, the UE shall stop timer T3440 and respond to the network initiated detach as specified in subclause\u00a05.5.2.3. In S101 mode, when the cdma2000\u00ae HRPD radio access connection has been released, the UE shall enter EMM-IDLE mode and consider the S101 mode NAS signalling connection released.",

The UE shall stop the timer T3417 and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED. If the service type information element in the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message indicates \"mobile terminating CS fallback or 1xCS fallback\" and the CSFB response IE, if included, indicates \"CS fallback accepted by the UE\", or if the service type information element in the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message indicates \"mobile originating CS fallback or 1xCS fallback\" or \"mobile originating CS fallback emergency call or 1xCS fallback emergency call\", the network initiates CS fallback or 1xCS fallback procedures. If the EPS bearer context status IE is included in the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message, the network shall deactivate all those EPS bearer contexts locally (without peer-to-peer signalling between the network and the UE) which are active on the network side but are indicated by the UE as being inactive. If the SERVICE REQUEST message or the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message for packet services, was sent in a CSG cell and the CSG subscription has expired or was removed for a UE, but the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established, the network shall accept the SERVICE REQUEST message or the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message for packet services and deactivate all non-emergency EPS bearers locally. The emergency EPS bearers shall not be deactivated. For cases d in subclause\u00a05.6.1.1, and for case e in subclause\u00a05.6.1.1 when the CSFB response was set to \"CS fallback accepted by the UE\", the UE shall treat the indication from the lower layers that the inter-system change from S1 mode to A/Gb or Iu mode is completed as successful completion of the procedure. The EMM sublayer in the UE shall indicate to the MM sublayer that the CS fallback procedure has succeeded. The UE shall stop the timer T3417ext and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE. If the service request procedure was initiated in EMM-IDLE mode and an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message was sent in a CSG cell and the CSG subscription has expired or was removed for the UE, the network need not perform CSG access control if the service type information element indicates \"mobile originating CS fallback emergency call or 1xCS fallback emergency call\".

For cases i and j in subclause\u00a05.6.1.1, if the UE receives the indication from the lower layers that the signalling connection is released, the UE shall consider the service request procedure successfully completed, stop timer T3417 and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE. If the SERVICE REQUEST message or an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message for packet services was used, the UE shall locally deactivate the EPS bearer contexts that do not have a user plane radio bearer established upon successful completion of the service request procedure. If the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message is for CS fallback or 1xCS fallback and radio bearer establishment takes place during the procedure, the UE shall locally deactivate the EPS bearer contexts that do not have a user plane radio bearer established upon receiving a lower layer indication of radio bearer establishment. The UE does not perform local deactivation of EPS bearer contexts upon receiving an indication of inter-system change from lower layers. If the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message is for CS fallback or 1xCS fallback and radio bearer establishment does not take place during the procedure, the UE does not perform local deactivation of the EPS bearer context. The UE does not perform local deactivation of EPS bearer contexts upon receiving an indication of inter-system change from lower layers.

and c)\tif the timer value indicates that this timer is zero, the UE shall proceed as specified in clause\u00a05.5.1.2.6 item\u00a0d. If the Back-off timer value IE is not included and the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST was sent standalone, then the UE shall ignore the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network in PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT, if any. 1)\tAdditionally, if the ESM cause value is #8 \"operator determined barring\", #27 \"missing or unknown APN\", #32 \"service option not supported\", or #33 \"requested service option not subscribed\", the UE shall proceed as follows: -\tif the UE is registered in the HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present), the UE shall behave as described above in the present clause, using the configured SM_RetryWaitTime value as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A] or in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17], if available, as back-off timer value; and NOTE\u00a00:\tThe way to choose one of the configured SM_RetryWaitTime values for back-off timer value is up to UE implementation if the UE is configured with:\n-\tan SM_RetryWaitTime value in ME as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A]; and\n-\tan SM_RetryWaitTime value in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]. -\totherwise, if the UE is not registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present), or if the SM_RetryWaitTime value is not configured, the UE shall behave as described above in the present clause, using the default value of 12 minutes for the back-off timer. 2)\tFor ESM cause values different from #8 \"operator determined barring\", #27 \"missing or unknown APN\", #32 \"service option not supported\", or #33 \"requested service option not subscribed\", the UE behaviour regarding the start of a back-off timer is specified in clause\u00a06.3.6. The UE shall not stop any back-off timer upon a PLMN change or inter-system change. If the network indicates that a back-off timer for the PDN connectivity procedure and PLMN and APN combination is deactivated, then it remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change. NOTE\u00a01:\tThis means the back-off timer can still be running or be deactivated for the given ESM procedure and PLMN and APN combination when the UE returns to the PLMN or when it performs inter-system change back from A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode to S1 mode. Thus the UE can still be prevented from sending another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same APN. If the Back-off timer value IE is not included and the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST was sent together with an ATTACH REQUEST, the UE shall ignore the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network in PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT, if any, and proceed as specified in clause\u00a05.5.1.2.6, item\u00a0d. If the back-off timer is started upon receipt of a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT (i.e. the timer value was provided by the network, a configured value is available or the default value is used as explained above) or the back-off timer is deactivated, the UE behaves as follows: 1)\tafter a PLMN change the UE may send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN in the new PLMN, if the back-off timer is not running and is not deactivated for the PDN connectivity procedure and the combination of new PLMN and APN; Furthermore as an implementation option, for the ESM cause values #8 \"operator determined barring\", #27 \"missing or unknown APN\", #32 \"service option not supported\" or #33 \"requested service option not subscribed\", if the network does not include a Re-attempt indicator IE, the UE may decide not to automatically send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN that was sent by the UE using the same PDN type, or the UE may decide not to automatically send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message included in an ATTACH REQUEST message without an APN using the same PDN type if the UE did not provide any APN in the PDN connectivity procedure, if the UE is registered to a new PLMN which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs. 2)\tif the network does not include the Re-attempt indicator IE to indicate whether re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode is allowed, or the UE ignores the Re-attempt indicator IE, e.g. because the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then: -\tif the UE is registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present), the UE shall apply the configured SM_RetryAtRATChange value as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A] or in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17], if available, to determine whether the UE may attempt a PDP context activation procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in A/Gb or Iu mode or a PDU session establishment procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in N1 mode; and NOTE\u00a02:\tThe way to choose one of the configured SM_RetryAtRATChange values for back-off timer value is up to UE implementation if the UE is configured with: -\tan SM_RetryAtRATChange value in ME as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A]; and -\tan SM_RetryAtRATChange value in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]. -\tif the UE is not registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present), or if the NAS configuration MO as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A] is not available and the value for inter-system change is not configured in the USIM file NASCONFIG, then the UE behaviour regarding a PDP context activation procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in A/Gb or Iu mode and a PDU session establishment procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in N1 mode are unspecified; and 3)\tif the network includes the Re-attempt indicator IE indicating that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not allowed, then depending on the timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE, for each combination of a PLMN from the equivalent PLMN list and the APN the UE shall start a back-off timer for the PDN connectivity procedure with the value provided by the network, or deactivate the respective back-off timer as follows: -\tif the Re-attempt indicator IE additionally indicates that re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode is allowed, the UE shall start or deactivate the back-off timer for S1 mode only; and -\totherwise the UE shall start or deactivate the back-off timer for A/Gb, Iu, S1 and N1 mode. If the back-off timer for a PLMN and APN combination was started or deactivated in A/Gb or Iu mode upon receipt of an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT REJECT message (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13]) and the network indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is allowed, then this back-off timer does not prevent the UE from sending a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode. If the network indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is not allowed, the UE shall not send any PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode until the timer expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed. If a back-off timer for a PLMN and APN combination, in combination with any S-NSSAI or without S-NSSAI (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54]) was started or deactivated in N1 mode upon receipt of a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REJECT message (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54]) and the network indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is allowed, then this back-off timer does not prevent the UE from sending a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode. If the network indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is not allowed, the UE shall not send any PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode until the timer expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed. If more than one back-off timers for the same PLMN and APN combination was started in N1 mode with an indication from the network that re-attempt in S1 mode is not allowed and no back-off timer for the same PLMN and APN combination was deactivated in N1 mode, the UE shall not send any PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode until all timers have expired. If at least one back-off timer for the same PLMN and APN combination was deactivated in N1 mode, the UE shall not send any PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed. NOTE\u00a03:\tThe back-off timer is used to describe a logical model of the required UE behaviour. This model does not imply any specific implementation, e.g. as a timer or timestamp. NOTE\u00a04:\tReference to back-off timer in this section can either refer to use of timer T3396 or to use of a different packet system specific timer within the UE. Whether the UE uses T3396 as a back-off timer or it uses different packet system specific timers as back-off timers is left up to UE implementation. This back-off timer is stopped when the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed. When the back-off timer is running or the timer is deactivated, the UE is allowed to initiate an attach procedure or PDN connectivity procedure if the procedure is for emergency bearer services. If the ESM cause value is #28 \"unknown PDN type\" and the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message contained a PDN type IE indicating a PDN connection type, the UE shall ignore the Back-off timer value IE and Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any. The UE may send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with the PDN type IE indicating another PDN connection type. If the ESM cause value is #50 \"PDN type IPv4 only allowed\", #51 \"PDN type IPv6 only allowed\", #57 \"PDN type IPv4v6 only allowed\", #58 \"PDN type non IP only allowed\" or #61 \"PDN type Ethernet only allowed\", the UE shall ignore the Back-off timer value IE provided by the network, if any. The UE shall not automatically send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN that was sent by the UE to obtain a PDN type different from the one allowed by the network until any of the following conditions is fulfilled: -\tthe UE is registered to a new PLMN, and either the network did not include a Re-attempt indicator IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message or the Re-attempt indicator IE included in the message indicated that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is allowed; -\tthe UE is registered to a new PLMN which was not in the list of equivalent PLMNs at the time when the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message was received; -\tthe UE is switched off; or -\tthe USIM is removed. For the ESM cause values #50 \"PDN type IPv4 only allowed\", #51 \"PDN type IPv6 only allowed\", #57 \"PDN type IPv4v6 only allowed\", #58 \"PDN type non IP only allowed\" and #61 \"PDN type Ethernet only allowed\", the UE shall ignore the value of the RATC bit in the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any. NOTE\u00a05:\tFor the ESM cause values #50 \"PDN type IPv4 only allowed\", #51 \"PDN type IPv6 only allowed\", #57 \"PDN type IPv4v6 only allowed\", #58 \"PDN type non IP only allowed\" and #61 \"PDN type Ethernet only allowed\", re-attempt in A/Gb, Iu, or N1 mode for the same APN (or no APN, if no APN was indicated by the UE) is only allowed using the PDN type(s) indicated by the network. Furthermore as an implementation option, for the SM cause values #50 \"PDN type IPv4 only allowed\", #51 \"PDN type IPv6 only allowed\", #57 \"PDN type IPv4v6 only allowed\", #58 \"PDN type non IP only allowed\" and #61 \"PDN type Ethernet only allowed\", if the network does not include a Re-attempt indicator IE the UE may decide not to automatically send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN that was sent by the UE using the same PDN type, if the UE is registered to a new PLMN which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs. NOTE\u00a06:\tRequest to send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with a specific PDN type has to come from upper layers. If the ESM cause value is #65 \"maximum number of EPS bearers reached\", the UE shall determine the PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode (see clause\u00a06.5.0) as the number of active EPS bearer contexts it has. The UE shall ignore the Back-off timer value IE and Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any. NOTE\u00a07:\tIn some situations, when attempting to establish multiple EPS bearer contexts, the number of active EPS bearer contexts that the UE has when ESM cause #65 is received is not equal to the maximum number of EPS bearer contexts reached in the network. NOTE\u00a08:\tWhen the network supports emergency bearer services, it is not expected that ESM cause #65 is returned by the network when the UE requests a PDN connection for emergency bearer services. The PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode applies to the PLMN in which the ESM cause #65 \"maximum number of EPS bearers reached\" is received.

Upon successful registration with a new PLMN, the UE may clear previous determinations representing any PLMN's maximum number(s) of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode. If the ESM cause value is #66 \"requested APN not supported in current RAT and PLMN combination\", the UE shall take different actions depending on the Back-off timer value IE and the Re-attempt indicator IE optionally included: 1)\tIf the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent standalone, the Back-off timer value IE is not included, and either the Re-attempt indicator IE is not included or the Re-attempt indicator IE is included indicating that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is allowed, the UE shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN in the current PLMN in S1 mode until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed; 2)\tif the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent standalone, the Back-off timer value IE is not included, and the Re-attempt indicator IE is included and indicates that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not allowed, the UE shall not send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN in any PLMN in the list of equivalent PLMNs in S1 mode until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed; 3)\tif the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent standalone and the Back-off timer value IE is included, the UE shall take different actions depending on the timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE (if the UE is a UE configured to use AC11\u00a0\u2013\u00a015 in selected PLMN, exceptions are specified in clause\u00a06.3.6): i)\tif the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall start the back-off timer with the value provided in the Back-off timer value IE for the PLMN and APN combination and shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST for the same  in the current PLMN in S1 mode until the back-off timer expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed; ii)\tif the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN in the current PLMN in S1 mode until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed; and iii)\tif the timer value indicates that this timer is zero, the UE may send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN in the current PLMN; and 4)\tif the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent together with an ATTACH REQUEST, the UE shall take different actions depending on the integrity protection of the ATTACH REJECT message (if the UE is a UE configured to use AC11\u00a0\u2013\u00a015 in selected PLMN, exceptions are specified in clause\u00a06.3.6): i)\tif the ATTACH REJECT message is not integrity protected, regardless whether the Back-off timer IE is included, the UE shall start the back-off timer with a random value from a default range specified in table\u00a011.2.3(see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13]), and shall not initiate a new attach procedure or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the current PLMN in S1 mode with the same APN that was sent by the UE, until the back-off timer expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed; and ii)\tif the ATTACH REJECT message is integrity protected, the UE shall proceed as follows: a)\tif the Back-off timer value IE is included and the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall start the back-off timer with the value provided in the Back-off timer value IE for the PDN connectivity procedure and PLMN and APN combination and shall not initiate a new attach procedure or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the current PLMN in S1 mode with the same APN that was sent by the UE, until the back-off timer expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed; b)\tif the Back-off timer value IE is included and the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE shall not initiate a new attach procedure or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the current PLMN in S1 mode with the same APN that was sent by the UE, until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed; c)\tif the Back-off timer value IE is included and the timer value indicates that this timer is zero, the UE shall proceed as specified in clause\u00a05.5.1.2.6 item\u00a0d; d)\tif the Back-off timer value IE is not included, and either the Re-attempt indicator IE is not included or the Re-attempt indicator IE is included indicating that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is allowed, the UE shall not initiate a new attach procedure or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN in the current PLMN in S1 mode until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed; and e)\tif the Back-off timer value IE is not included, and the Re-attempt indicator IE is included and indicates that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not allowed, the UE shall not initiate a new attach procedure or send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN in any PLMN in the list of equivalent PLMNs in S1 mode until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed. NOTE\u00a09:\tReceiving ESM cause value #66 during an attach procedure without APN is not expected and the UE behaviour is implementation specific. If the network includes the Re-attempt indicator IE indicating that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not allowed, then -\tfor cases\u00a03.i, 4.i and 4.ii.a the UE shall additionally start a back-off timer with the value provided in the Back-off timer value IE for the PDN connectivity procedure for each combination of a PLMN from the equivalent PLMN list and the APN; and -\tfor cases\u00a03.ii and 4.ii.b the UE shall deactivate the respective back-off timers for the PDN connectivity procedure for each combination of a PLMN from the equivalent PLMN list and the APN. For the ESM cause value #66 \"requested APN not supported in current RAT and PLMN combination\" the UE shall ignore the value of the RATC bit in the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any. As an implementation option, for cases\u00a01, 3.i, 3.ii, 4.iv, 4.v.a and 4.v.b, if the Re-attempt indicator IE is not included, the UE may decide not to automatically send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN in a PLMN which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs. If the ESM cause value is #54 \"PDN connection does not exist\", the UE shall ignore the Back-off timer value IE and Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any, and take different actions as follows: -\tif the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent standalone, the UE shall set the request type to \"initial request\" in the subsequent PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message to establish a PDN connectivity to the same APN; -\tif the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent together with an ATTACH REQUEST message, the UE shall set the request type to \"initial request\" in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message which is included in the subsequent ATTACH REQUEST message to establish a PDN connectivity to the same APN. NOTE\u00a010:\tUser interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot re-activate the EPS bearer context(s) automatically. If the PDN connection is for UAS services, and the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message includes the extended protocol configuration options IE containing the service-level-AA container with the length of two octets , and the service-level-AA container with the length of two octets contains the service-level-AA response parameter with the SLAR field set to \"Service level authentication and authorization was not successful or service level authorization is revoked\", then the UE supporting UAS services shall consider the UUAA procedure as failed and not attempt to establish a PDN connection for UAS services. 6.5.1.4A\tHandling the maximum number of active EPS bearer contexts If the maximum number of active EPS bearer contexts is reached at the UE (see clause\u00a06.5.0) and the upper layers of the UE request connectivity to a PDN the UE shall not send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message unless an active EPS bearer is deactivated. If the UE needs to de-activate an active EPS bearer context, choosing which EPS bearer context to de-activate is implementation specific, however the UE shall not deactivate an EPS bearer context for emergency. NOTE:\tClause\u00a06.5.1.6 specifies that a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with the same combination of APN and PDN type as an already existing, non-emergency PDN connection can be acceptable, in some cases. In these cases the UE does not need to de-activate an active EPS bearer context if the maximum number of active EPS bearer contexts is reached at the UE. If the UE needs to de-activate an EPS bearer context in order to request an emergency EPS bearer context, it shall either de-activate an EPS bearer context locally or via explicit signalling. If the UE performs local de-activation, the UE shall perform tracking area updating procedure to indicate EPS bearer context status to the network. 6.5.1.4B\tVoid 6.5.1.4C\tHandling the maximum number of active user plane radio bearers in NB-S1 mode When the maximum number of active user plane radio bearers in NB-S1 mode is reached (see clause\u00a06.5.0) and upper layers request for more DRBs for PDN connections other than PDN connections with those DRBs, the UE can choose to release one or more of the PDN connections to cater for the upper layer request. The choice of which PDN connection to be released is implementation specific. If the maximum number of active user plane radio bearers in NB-S1 mode is reached and the upper layers of the UE request user-plane resources for exception data reporting, the UE shall release a PDN connection that has user-plane resources to cater for the request for exception data reporting. The choice of which PDN connection to be released is implementation specific. If the UE needs to release a PDN connection for the reasons stated in this clause, a PDN connection that is used for exception data reporting shall not be released. If the UE releases a PDN connection to cater for the upper layer request, the UE shall release the PDN connection via explicit ESM signalling.",

    "text": "If the bearer resource allocation requested cannot be accepted by the network, the MME shall send a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message to the UE. The message shall contain the PTI and an ESM cause value indicating the reason for rejecting the UE requested bearer resource allocation. The ESM cause value typically indicates one of the following: #26:\tinsufficient resources; #30:\trequest rejected by Serving GW or PDN GW; #31:\trequest rejected, unspecified; #32:\tservice option not supported; #33:\trequested service option not subscribed; #34:\tservice option temporarily out of order; #35:\tPTI already in use; #37:\tEPS QoS not accepted; #41:\tsemantic error in the TFT operation; #42:\tsyntactical error in the TFT operation; #43:\tinvalid EPS bearer identity; #44:\tsemantic error(s) in packet filter(s); #45:\tsyntactical error(s) in packet filter(s); #56:\tcollision with network initiated request; #59:\tunsupported QCI value; #60:\tbearer handling not supported; or #95 \u2013 111:\tprotocol errors. If the bearer resource allocation requested is for an established LIPA PDN connection, then the network shall reply with a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message with ESM cause #60 \"bearer handling not supported\". If the requested new TFT is not available, then the BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message shall be sent. The TFT in the request message is checked by the network for different types of TFT IE errors as follows: a)\tSemantic errors in TFT operations: 1)\tWhen the TFT operation is an operation other than \"Create a new TFT\". The network shall reject the allocation request with ESM cause #41 \"semantic error in the TFT operation\". b)\tSyntactical errors in TFT operations: 1)\tWhen the TFT operation = \"Create a new TFT\" and the packet filter list in the TFT IE is empty. 2)\tWhen there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of the TFT IE, such as a mismatch between the number of packet filters subfield, and the number of packet filters in the packet filter list. The network shall reject the allocation request with ESM cause #42 \"syntactical error in the TFT operation\". c)\tSemantic errors in packet filters: When a packet filter consists of conflicting packet filter components which would render the packet filter ineffective, i.e. no IP packet will ever fit this packet filter. How the network determines a semantic error in a packet filter is outside the scope of the present document. The network shall reject the allocation request with ESM cause #44 \"semantic errors in packet filter(s)\". d)\tSyntactical errors in packet filters: 1)\t\tWhen the TFT operation = \"Create a new TFT\" and two or more packet filters among all TFTs associated with the PDN connection would have identical packet filter precedence values. 2)\tWhen there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of packet filters, such as the use of a reserved value for a packet filter component identifier. In case 1, if the old packet filters do not belong to the default EPS bearer context, the network shall not diagnose an error, shall further process the new request and, if it was processed successfully, shall delete the old packet filters which have identical filter precedence values. Furthermore, the network shall perform an EPS bearer context deactivation request procedure to deactivate the dedicated EPS bearer context(s) for which it has deleted the packet filters. In case 1, if one or more old packet filters belong to the default EPS bearer context, the network shall release the relevant PDN connection using the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure.If it is the last PDN connection, the network shall detach the UE using detach type \"re-attach required\". Otherwise the network shall reject the allocation request with ESM cause #45 \"syntactical errors in packet filter(s)\". If the ESM cause value is #26 \"insufficient resources\", the network may include a value for timer T3396 value IE in the BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message. Upon receipt of a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message, the UE shall stop the timer T3480, release the traffic flow aggregate description associated to the PTI value, and enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE. If the ESM cause value is #26 \"insufficient resources\" and T3396 value IE is included: -\tif the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall start T3396 and not try to send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST messages for the same APN until timer T3396 expires, the timer T3396 is stopped, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed; -\tif the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST messages for the same APN until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed or the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same APN from the network; or -\tif the timer value indicates zero, the UE may send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST messages for the same APN. If the T3396 IE is not included, the UE may send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST messages for the same APN. If the UE is switched off when the timer T3396 is running, the UE behaves as follows when the UE is switched on: -\tlet t1 be the time remaining for T3396 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 \u2013 t. If t1 is equal to or less than t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer with the value t1. The further actions to be performed by the UE are implementation dependent as part of upper layers responsibility.",

The message shall contain the PTI and an ESM cause value indicating the reason for rejecting the UE requested bearer resource modification. The ESM cause value typically indicates one of the following: #26:\tinsufficient resources; #30:\trequest rejected by Serving GW or PDN GW; #31:\trequest rejected, unspecified; #32:\tservice option not supported; #33:\trequested service option not subscribed; #34:\tservice option temporarily out of order; #35:\tPTI already in use; #37:\tEPS QoS not accepted; #41:\tsemantic error in the TFT operation; #42:\tsyntactical error in the TFT operation; #43:\tinvalid EPS bearer identity; #44:\tsemantic error(s) in packet filter(s); #45:\tsyntactical error(s) in packet filter(s); #56:\tcollision with network initiated request; #59:\tunsupported QCI value; #60:\tbearer handling not supported; or #95 \u2013 111:\tprotocol errors. If the bearer resource modification requested is for an established LIPA PDN connection or SIPTO at the local network PDN connection, then the network shall reply with a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message with ESM cause #60 \"bearer handling not supported\". If the requested new TFT is not available, then the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message shall be sent. The TFT in the request message is checked by the network for different types of TFT IE errors as follows: a)\tSemantic errors in TFT operations: 1)\tWhen the TFT operation is an operation other than \"Replace packet filters in existing TFT\", \"Add packet filters to existing TFT\", \"Delete packet filters from existing TFT\" or \"No TFT operation\". 2)\tWhen the TFT operation is \"Replace packet filters in existing TFT\", \"Add packet filters to existing TFT\" or \"Delete packet filters from existing TFT\", the EPS bearer context being modified is the default EPS bearer content and there is no TFT for the default EPS bearer context. 3)\tTFT operation = \"Delete packet filters from existing TFT\" when it would render the TFT empty. In case 1 the network shall reject the modification request with ESM cause #41 \"semantic error in the TFT operation\". In case 2, if the TFT operation is \"Delete packet filters from existing TFT\", the network shall further process the new request and, if no error according to items b, c, and d was detected, shall perform an EPS bearer context modification procedure including the value of EPS bearer identity for packet filter IE in the EPS bearer identity IE and a TFT IE with TFT operation = \"Delete existing TFT\" in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message. In case 2, if the TFT operation is \"Replace packet filters in existing TFT\" or \"Add packet filters to existing TFT\", the network shall process the new request as a request with TFT operation = \"Create a new TFT\". In case 3, if the packet filters belong to a dedicated EPS bearer context, the network shall process the new deletion request and, if no error according to items b, c, and d was detected, delete the existing TFT. After successful deletion of the TFT, the network shall perform an EPS bearer context deactivation request procedure to deactivate the dedicated EPS bearer context between the UE and the network. In case 3, if the packet filters belong to the default EPS bearer context, the network shall process the new deletion request and if no error according to items b, c, and d was detected then perform an EPS bearer context modification procedure to remove the existing TFT of the default EPS bearer context, this corresponds to using match-all packet filter for the default EPS bearer context. b)\tSyntactical errors in TFT operations: 1)\tWhen the TFT operation = \"Replace packet filters in existing TFT\", \"Add packet filters to existing TFT\" or \"Delete packet filters from existing TFT\", and the packet filter list in the TFT IE is empty. 2)\tTFT operation = \"No TFT operation\" with a non-empty packet filter list in the TFT IE. 3)\tTFT operation = \"Replace packet filters in existing TFT\" when the packet filter to be replaced does not exist in the original TFT. 4)\tTFT operation = \"Delete packet filters from existing TFT\" when the packet filter to be deleted does not exist in the original TFT. 5)\tVoid 6)\tWhen there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of the TFT IE, such as a mismatch between the number of packet filters subfield, and the number of packet filters in the packet filter list. 7)\tTFT operation = \"No TFT operation\" with an empty parameters list. In case 3 the network shall not diagnose an error, shall further process the replace request and, if no error according to items c and d was detected, shall perform an EPS bearer context modification procedure using TFT operation = \"Add packet filters to existing TFT\" to include the packet filters received to the existing TFT. In case 4 the network shall not diagnose an error, shall further process the deletion request and, if no error according to items c and d was detected, shall perform an EPS bearer context modification procedure including the value of EPS bearer identity for packet filter IE in the EPS bearer identity IE and a TFT IE with TFT operation = \"Delete packet filters from existing TFT\" and the received packet filter identifier(s) in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message. Otherwise the network shall reject the modification request with ESM cause #42 \"syntactical error in the TFT operation\". c)\tSemantic errors in packet filters: 1)\tWhen a packet filter consists of conflicting packet filter components which would render the packet filter ineffective, i.e. no IP packet will ever fit this packet filter. How the network determines a semantic error in a packet filter is outside the scope of the present document. 2)\tWhen the resulting TFT, which is assigned to a dedicated EPS bearer context, does not contain any packet filter applicable for the uplink direction. The network shall reject the modification request with ESM cause #44 \"semantic errors in packet filter(s)\". d)\tSyntactical errors in packet filters: 1)\tWhen the TFT operation = \"Replace packet filters in existing TFT\" or \"Add packet filters to existing TFT\", and two or more packet filters in the resultant TFT would have identical packet filter identifiers. 2)\tWhen the TFT operation = \"Replace packet filters in existing TFT\" or \"Add packet filters to existing TFT\", and two or more packet filters in all TFTs associated with the PDN connection would have identical packet filter precedence values. 3)\tWhen there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of packet filters, such as the use of a reserved value for a packet filter component identifier. In case 2, if the old packet filters do not belong to the default EPS bearer context, the network shall not diagnose an error, shall further process the new request and, if it was processed successfully, shall delete the old packet filters which have identical filter precedence values. Furthermore, the network shall perform an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure to deactivate the dedicated EPS bearer context(s) for which it has deleted the packet filters. In case 2, if one or more old packet filters belong to the default EPS bearer context, the network shall release the relevant PDN connection using the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure. If the relevant PDN connection is the last one and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, the network shall detach the UE using detach type \"re-attach required\". Otherwise the network shall reject the modification request with ESM cause #45 \"syntactical errors in packet filter(s)\". The network may include a Back-off timer value IE in the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message. The network shall not include the ESM cause value #26 \"insufficient resources\" in the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message due to APN based congestion control being active. If the Back-off timer value IE is included and the ESM cause value is not #26 \"insufficient resources\", the network may include the Re-attempt indicator IE to indicate: -\twhether the UE is allowed to attempt a PDP context modification procedure in the PLMN for the same  in A/Gb or Iu mode or a PDU session modification procedure in the PLMN for the same APN in N1 mode; and -\twhether another attempt in A/Gb and Iu mode, in S1 mode or in N1 mode is allowed in an equivalent PLMN. Upon receipt of a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message, the UE shall stop the timer T3481, release the traffic flow aggregate description associated to the PTI value, and enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE. If the ESM cause included in the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message is #43 \"invalid EPS bearer identity\", the UE locally deactivates the EPS bearer context(s) without peer-to-peer ESM signalling.",

The message shall contain the PTI and an ESM cause value indicating the reason for rejecting the UE requested bearer resource allocation. The ESM cause value typically indicates one of the following: #26:\tinsufficient resources; #30:\trequest rejected by Serving GW or PDN GW; #31:\trequest rejected, unspecified; #32:\tservice option not supported; #33:\trequested service option not subscribed; #34:\tservice option temporarily out of order; #35:\tPTI already in use; #37:\tEPS QoS not accepted; #41:\tsemantic error in the TFT operation; #42:\tsyntactical error in the TFT operation; #43:\tinvalid EPS bearer identity; #44:\tsemantic error(s) in packet filter(s); #45:\tsyntactical error(s) in packet filter(s); #56:\tcollision with network initiated request; #59:\tunsupported QCI value; #60:\tbearer handling not supported; #65:\tmaximum number of EPS bearers reached; or #95 \u2013 111:\tprotocol errors. If the bearer resource allocation requested is for an established LIPA PDN connection or SIPTO at the local network PDN connection, then the network shall reply with a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message with ESM cause #60 \"bearer handling not supported\". If the requested new TFT is not available, then the BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message shall be sent. The TFT in the request message is checked by the network for different types of TFT IE errors as follows: a)\tSemantic errors in TFT operations: 1)\tWhen the TFT operation is an operation other than \"Create a new TFT\". The network shall reject the allocation request with ESM cause #41 \"semantic error in the TFT operation\". b)\tSyntactical errors in TFT operations: 1)\tWhen the TFT operation = \"Create a new TFT\" and the packet filter list in the TFT IE is empty. 2)\tWhen there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of the TFT IE, such as a mismatch between the number of packet filters subfield, and the number of packet filters in the packet filter list. The network shall reject the allocation request with ESM cause #42 \"syntactical error in the TFT operation\". c)\tSemantic errors in packet filters: 1)\tWhen a packet filter consists of conflicting packet filter components which would render the packet filter ineffective, i.e. no IP packet will ever fit this packet filter. How the network determines a semantic error in a packet filter is outside the scope of the present document. 2)\tWhen the resulting TFT does not contain any packet filter which applicable for the uplink direction. The network shall reject the allocation request with ESM cause #44 \"semantic errors in packet filter(s)\". d)\tSyntactical errors in packet filters: 1)\tWhen the TFT operation = \"Create a new TFT\" and two or more packet filters in the resultant TFT would have identical packet filter identifiers. 2)\tWhen the TFT operation = \"Create a new TFT\" and two or more packet filters among all TFTs associated with the PDN connection would have identical packet filter precedence values. 3)\tWhen there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of packet filters, such as the use of a reserved value for a packet filter component identifier. In case 2, if the old packet filters do not belong to the default EPS bearer context, the network shall not diagnose an error, shall further process the new request and, if it was processed successfully, shall delete the old packet filters which have identical filter precedence values. Furthermore, the network shall perform an EPS bearer context deactivation request procedure to deactivate the dedicated EPS bearer context(s) for which it has deleted the packet filters. In case 2, if one or more old packet filters belong to the default EPS bearer context, the network shall release the relevant PDN connection using the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure. If it is the last remaining PDN connection and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, the network shall detach the UE using detach type \"re-attach required\". Otherwise the network shall reject the allocation request with ESM cause #45 \"syntactical errors in packet filter(s)\". The network may include a Back-off timer value IE in the BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message. If the Back-off timer value IE is included and the ESM cause value is different from #26 \"insufficient resources\" and #65 \"maximum number of EPS bearers reached\", the network may include the Re-attempt indicator IE to indicate: -\twhether the UE is allowed to attempt a secondary PDP context activation procedure in the PLMN for the same  in A/Gb or Iu mode or a PDU session modification procedure in the PLMN for the same APN in N1 mode; and -\twhether another attempt in A/Gb and Iu mode, in S1 mode or in N1 mode is allowed in an equivalent PLMN.

The emergency EPS bearers shall not be deactivated. For cases d in clause\u00a05.6.1.1, and for case e in clause\u00a05.6.1.1 when the CSFB response was set to \"CS fallback accepted by the UE\", the UE shall treat the indication from the lower layers that the inter-system change from S1 mode to A/Gb or Iu mode is completed as successful completion of the procedure.

NOTE:\tFor some cases of CS fallback or 1x CS fallback the network can decide not to set up any S1 and radio bearers. Upon receipt of the SERVICE REQUEST message, the MME shall delete any stored paging restriction for the UE and stop restricting paging. If the MUSIM UE does not include the Paging restriction IE in the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message, the MME shall delete any stored paging restriction for the UE and stop restricting paging.

If the network supports service gap control (SGC) feature and the service gap time value is available in the EMM context of the UE, the MME shall consider SGC as active for the UE. The UE and the network negotiate usage of the service gap control (SGC) feature during the attach and tracking area updating procedures: -\tthe UE supporting service gap control indicates its support for service gap control in the ATTACH REQUEST and TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. If the UE supports service gap control and the SGC is active for the UE, the MME shall include service gap timer T3447 value in the ATTACH ACCEPT message and TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message (see clause\u00a05.5.1.2 and clause\u00a05.5.3.2). The UE shall store the service gap time value; and -\tfor UEs that do not support the optional SGC feature when the network rejects mobility management signalling requests due to service gap control is active in the network, the mechanism for general NAS level mobility management congestion control as specified in clause\u00a05.3.9 applies. The UE shall start the SGC timer T3447 when the NAS signalling connection is released and if: -\tthe UE supports SGC feature, and the service gap timer value is available in the UE and does not indicate zero; and -\tthe NAS signalling connection released was not established for: -\tpaging; -\tattach requests without PDN connection request; or -\ttracking area update requests without \"active\" or \"signalling active\" flag set. If the SGC is active in the network, after the UE transitions from EMM-CONNECTED mode to EMM-IDLE mode except when the UE was in EMM-CONNECTED mode due to: -\tpaging; -\tattach requests without PDN connection request; or -\ttracking area update requests without \"active\" or \"signalling active\" flag set, the network shall start the SGC timer T3447: -\twith the service gap time value available in the EMM context minus 4 minutes, if the UE supports SGC feature and the service gap time value has been sent to the UE with a non-zero value; or -\twith the service gap time value available in the EMM context if the UE does not support SGC feature. When the SGC timer T3447 is running, the network allows: -\trequests for emergency bearer services; -\trequests for exception data reporting; -\tattach requests without PDN connection request; -\ttracking area update requests without \"active\" or \"signalling active\" flag set; -\trequests from UEs that were received via NAS signalling connections established with RRC establishment cause \"High priority access AC 11 \u2013 15\"; and -\tmobile terminated service requests triggered by paging and subsequent MO signalling or MO data, if any, until the UE enters EMM-IDLE mode. If the MME determines that the UE operating in single-registration mode has performed an inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode and the timer T3447 is running in the MME, the MME stops the T3447. Upon inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, if the UE supports service gap control, T3447 is running in the UE, and the T3447 value is included in the ATTACH ACCEPT message or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message received from the MME (see clause\u00a05.5.1.2 and clause\u00a05.5.3.2), the UE shall keep T3447 running. Additionally, the UE shall store and replace the currently stored T3447 value with the received T3447 value. Upon expiry of the running T3447 timer, the UE shall use the new value when starting T3447 again. The UE or the network with a running service gap timer shall keep the timer running when the UE transits from EMM-IDLE mode to EMM-CONNECTED mode. NOTE:\tIf the UE transitions from EMM-IDLE mode to EMM-CONNECTED mode due to attach request without PDN connection request or tracking area update request without \"active\" or \"signalling active\" flag set, the UE initiates no further MO signalling except for tracking area update request without \"active\" or \"signalling active\" flag set until the UE receives network-initiated signalling (e.g. DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message for MT SMS) or MT data over user plane, or after the UE has moved to EMM-IDLE state and the service gap timer is not running. If the timer T3447 is running when the UE enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE remains the same, then timer T3447 is kept running until it expires. If the UE is switched off when the timer T3447 is running, the UE shall behave as follows when the UE is switched on and the USIM in the UE remains the same: -\tlet t1 be the time remaining for T3447 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater than\u00a0t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 \u2013 t. If t1 is equal to or less than t, then the timer need not be restarted.

Authenticated UEs in limited service state may also be able to access restricted local operator services. The UE requests access to RLOS during the attach procedure by setting the attach type to \"EPS RLOS attach\" in the ATTACH REQUEST message. Subject to regulation and local operator policy, if the MME is configured to support access to RLOS, the MME accepts the UE's attach request regardless of the authentication result or skips the authentication procedure. When the UE requests the lower layer to establish an RRC connection for access to RLOS, the UE indicates in the RRC signalling that the RRC connection is for access to RLOS to the lower layers. The UE supporting access to RLOS shall perform PLMN selection according to 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.122\u00a0[6]. Broadcast system information may provide information about support of access to RLOS (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.331\u00a0[22]). At reception of new broadcast system information, the lower layers deliver it to the EMM layer in the UE. The information provided by lower layers is per PLMN and used by the UE to determine whether the PLMN is configured to support access to RLOS. The UE shall not attempt to request access to RLOS if the PLMN does not support access to RLOS. NOTE:\tOnly authorized applications on the UE are allowed to trigger the initiation of RLOS connection (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19]). For UE attached for access to RLOS, only UE originated access to RLOS requests are supported. Mobile terminated access to RLOS request and network triggered service request are not allowed. The UE is not allowed to initiate UE requested PDN connectivity for any additional PDN connection. In addition, intersystem change to other RAT including GERAN and UTRAN and handover between 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses are not supported. Access to RLOS is applicable to the UEs in WB-S1 mode only. The UEs in NB-S1 mode shall not request access to RLOS. Location service does not apply to access to RLOS. If a UE attached for access to RLOS needs to initiate an emergency call, the UE shall first perform a local detach prior to initiating an attach procedure for emergency bearer services.",

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then the UE shall ignore the Re-attempt Indicator IE provided by the network, if any. 1)\tAdditionally, if the ESM cause value is #32 \"service option not supported\", or #33 \"requested service option not subscribed\", the UE shall proceed as follows: -\tif the UE is registered in the HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present), the UE shall behave as described above in the present clause, using the configured SM_RetryWaitTime value as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A] or in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17], if available, as back-off timer value; and NOTE\u00a00:\tThe way to choose one of the configured SM_RetryWaitTime values for back-off timer value is up to UE implementation if the UE is configured with:\n-\tan SM_RetryWaitTime value in ME as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A]; and\n-\tan SM_RetryWaitTime value in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]. -\totherwise, if the UE is not registered in its HPLMN or a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present) or the SM_RetryWaitTime value is not configured, the UE shall behave as described above in the present clause, using the default value of 12 minutes for the back-off timer. 2)\tFor ESM cause values different from #32 \"service option not supported\", or #33 \"requested service option not subscribed\", the UE behaviour regarding the start of a back-off timer is specified in clause\u00a06.3.6. The UE shall not stop any back-off timer upon a PLMN change or inter-system change. If the network indicates that a back-off timer for the bearer resource allocation procedure and PLMN and APN combination is deactivated, then it remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change. NOTE\u00a01:\tThis means the back-off timer can still be running or be deactivated for the given ESM procedure and PLMN and APN combination when the UE returns to the PLMN or when it performs inter-system change back from A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode to S1 mode. Thus the UE can still be prevented from sending another BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same APN. If the back-off timer is started upon receipt of BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT (i.e. the timer value was provided by the network, a configured value is available or the default value is used as explained above) or the back-off timer is deactivated, the UE behaves as follows: 1)\tafter a PLMN change the UE may send a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the same APN in the new PLMN, if the back-off timer is not running and is not deactivated for the bearer resource allocation procedure and the combination of new PLMN and APN; Furthermore as an implementation option, for the ESM cause values #32 \"service option not supported\" or #33 \"requested service option not subscribed\", if the network does not include a Re-attempt indicator IE, the UE may decide not to automatically send another BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the same APN that was sent by the UE, if the UE is registered to a new PLMN which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs. 2)\tif the network does not include the Re-attempt indicator IE to indicate whether re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode is allowed, or the UE ignores the Re-attempt indicator IE, e.g. because the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then: -\tif the UE is registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present), the UE shall apply the configured SM_RetryAtRATChange value as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A] or in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17], if available, to determine whether the UE may attempt a secondary PDP context activation procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in A/Gb or Iu mode or a PDU session modification procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in N1 mode; and NOTE\u00a02:\tThe way to choose one of the configured SM_RetryAtRATChange values for back-off timer value is up to UE implementation if the UE is configured with: -\tan SM_RetryAtRATChange value in ME as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A]; and -\tan SM_RetryAtRATChange value in USIM file NASCONFIG as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]. -\tif the UE is not registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present), or if the NAS configuration MO as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A] is not available and the value for inter-system change is not configured in the USIM file NASCONFIG, then the UE behaviour regarding a secondary PDP context activation procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in A/Gb or Iu mode and a PDU session modification procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in N1 mode are unspecified; and 3)\tif the network includes the Re-attempt indicator IE indicating that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not allowed, then depending on the timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE, for each combination of a PLMN from the equivalent PLMN list and the APN the UE shall start a back-off timer for the bearer resource allocation procedure with the value provided by the network, or deactivate the respective back-off timer as follows: -\tif the Re-attempt indicator IE additionally indicates that re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode is allowed, the UE shall start or deactivate the back-off timer for S1 mode only; and -\totherwise the UE shall start or deactivate the back-off timer for A/Gb, Iu, S1 and N1 mode. If the back-off timer for a PLMN and APN combination was started or deactivated in A/Gb or Iu mode upon receipt of an ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP CONTEXT REJECT message (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13]) and the network indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is allowed, then this back-off timer does not prevent the UE from sending a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode. If the network indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is not allowed, the UE shall not send any BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode until the timer expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed. If a back-off timer for a PLMN and APN combination, in combination with any S-NSSAI or without S-NSSAI (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54]) was started or deactivated in N1 mode upon receipt of a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54]) and the network indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is allowed, then this back-off timer does not prevent the UE from sending a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode. If the network indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is not allowed, the UE shall not send any BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode until the timer expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed. If more than one back-off timer for the same PLMN and APN combination was started in N1 mode with an indication from the network that re-attempt in S1 mode is not allowed and no back-off timer for the same PLMN and APN combination was deactivated in N1 mode, the UE shall not send any BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode until all timers have expired. If at least one back-off timer for the same PLMN and APN combination was deactivated in N1 mode, the UE shall not send any BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed. NOTE\u00a03:\tThe back-off timer is used to describe a logical model of the required UE behaviour. This model does not imply any specific implementation, e.g. as a timer or timestamp. NOTE\u00a04:\tReference to back-off timer in this section can either refer to use of timer T3396 or to use of a different packet system specific timer within the UE. Whether the UE uses T3396 as a back-off timer or it uses different packet system specific timers as back-off timers is left up to UE implementation. This back-off timer is stopped when the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed. If the ESM cause value is #65 \"maximum number of EPS bearers reached\", the UE shall determine the PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode (see clause\u00a06.5.0) as the number of active EPS bearer contexts it has. The UE shall ignore the Back-off timer value IE and Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any. NOTE\u00a05:\tIn some situations, when attempting to establish multiple EPS bearer contexts, the number of active EPS bearer contexts in the UE when cause #65 is received is not equal to the maximum number of EPS bearer contexts reached in the network. The PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode applies to the PLMN in which the ESM cause #65 \"maximum number of EPS bearers reached\" is received. When the UE is switched off or when the USIM is removed, the UE shall clear all previous determinations representing any PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode. Upon successful registration with a new PLMN, the UE may clear previous determinations representing any PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode. The further actions to be performed by the UE are implementation dependent as part of upper layers responsibility. 6.5.3.4A\tHandling the maximum number of active EPS bearer contexts If the UE requests allocation of additional bearer resources, and the network has reached its maximum number of active EPS bearer contexts, then the network can: -\treject the request if the network decides that it is necessary to allocate a dedicated EPS bearer context; or -\taccept the request by sending a MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message. NOTE:\tAn example of where the network will reject the request for allocation of additional bearer resources is when the request includes a GBR requirement while all existing bearers are non-GBR bearers, and the maximum number of active EPS bearer contexts has been reached at the network. If the maximum number of active EPS bearer contexts is reached at the UE (see clause\u00a06.5.0) and the UE de-activates an active EPS bearer context prior to sending the request for additional bearer resources, then choosing which EPS bearer context to de-activate is a implementation specific, however the UE shall not deactivate a default EPS bearer context for emergency.",

The ESM cause value typically indicates one of the following: #26:\tinsufficient resources; #30:\trequest rejected by Serving GW or PDN GW; #31:\trequest rejected, unspecified; #32:\tservice option not supported; #33:\trequested service option not subscribed; #34:\tservice option temporarily out of order; #35:\tPTI already in use; #37:\tEPS QoS not accepted; #41:\tsemantic error in the TFT operation; #42:\tsyntactical error in the TFT operation; #43:\tinvalid EPS bearer identity; #44:\tsemantic error(s) in packet filter(s); #45:\tsyntactical error(s) in packet filter(s); #56:\tcollision with network initiated request; #59:\tunsupported QCI value; #60:\tbearer handling not supported; or #95 \u2013 111:\tprotocol errors. If the bearer resource modification requested is for an established LIPA PDN connection, then the network shall reply with a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message with ESM cause #60 \"bearer handling not supported\". If the requested new TFT is not available, then the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message shall be sent. The TFT in the request message is checked by the network for different types of TFT IE errors as follows: a)\tSemantic errors in TFT operations: 1)\tWhen the TFT operation is an operation other than \"Replace packet filters in existing TFT\", \"Add packet filters to existing TFT\", \"Delete packet filters from existing TFT\" or \"No TFT operation\". 2)\tWhen the TFT operation is \"Replace packet filters in existing TFT\", \"Add packet filters to existing TFT\" or \"Delete packet filters from existing TFT\" and there is no TFT for the default EPS bearer context. 3)\tTFT operation = \"Delete packet filters from existing TFT\" when it would render the TFT empty. In case 1 the network shall reject the modification request with ESM cause #41 \"semantic error in the TFT operation\". In case 2, if the TFT operation is \"Delete packet filters from existing TFT\", the network shall further process the new request and, if no error according to items b, c, and d was detected, shall perform an EPS bearer context modification procedure including the value of EPS bearer identity for packet filter IE in the EPS bearer identity IE and a TFT IE with TFT operation = \"Delete existing TFT\" in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message. In case 2, if the TFT operation is \"Replace packet filters in existing TFT\" or \"Add packet filters to existing TFT\", the network shall process the new request as a request with TFT operation = \"Create a new TFT\". In case 3, if the packet filters belong to a dedicated EPS bearer context, the network shall process the new deletion request and, if no error according to items b, c, and d was detected, delete the existing TFT. After successful deletion of the TFT, the network shall perform an EPS bearer context deactivation request procedure to deactivate the dedicated EPS bearer context between the UE and the network. In case 3, if the packet filters belong to the default EPS bearer context, the network shall process the new deletion request and if no error according to items b, c, and d was detected then perform an EPS bearer context modification procedure to remove the existing TFT of the default EPS bearer context, this corresponds to using match-all packet filter for the default EPS bearer context. b)\tSyntactical errors in TFT operations: 1)\tWhen the TFT operation = \"Replace packet filters in existing TFT\", \"Add packet filters to existing TFT\" or \"Delete packet filters from existing TFT\", and the packet filter list in the TFT IE is empty. 2)\tTFT operation = \"No TFT operation\" with a non-empty packet filter list in the TFT IE. 3)\tTFT operation = \"Replace packet filters in existing TFT\" when the packet filter to be replaced does not exist in the original TFT. 4)\tTFT operation = \"Delete packet filters from existing TFT\" when the packet filter to be deleted does not exist in the original TFT. 5)\tTFT operation = \"Delete packet filters from existing TFT\" with a packet filter list also including packet filters in addition to the packet filter identifiers. 6)\tWhen there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of the TFT IE, such as a mismatch between the number of packet filters subfield, and the number of packet filters in the packet filter list. In case 3 the network shall not diagnose an error, shall further process the replace request and, if no error according to items c and d was detected, shall perform an EPS bearer context modification procedure using TFT operation = \"Add packet filters to existing TFT\" to include the packet filters received to the existing TFT. In case 4 the network shall not diagnose an error, shall further process the deletion request and, if no error according to items c and d was detected, shall perform an EPS bearer context modification procedure including the value of EPS bearer identity for packet filter IE in the EPS bearer identity IE and a TFT IE with TFT operation = \"Delete packet filters from existing TFT\" and the received packet filter identifier(s) in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message. Otherwise the network shall reject the modification request with ESM cause #42 \"syntactical error in the TFT operation\". c)\tSemantic errors in packet filters: When a packet filter consists of conflicting packet filter components which would render the packet filter ineffective, i.e. no IP packet will ever fit this packet filter. How the network determines a semantic error in a packet filter is outside the scope of the present document. The network shall reject the modification request with ESM cause #44 \"semantic errors in packet filter(s)\". d)\tSyntactical errors in packet filters: 1)\tWhen the TFT operation = \"Replace packet filters in existing TFT\" and two or more packet filters in all TFTs associated with the PDN connection would have identical packet filter precedence values. 2)\tWhen there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of packet filters, such as the use of a reserved value for a packet filter component identifier. In case 1, if the old packet filters do not belong to the default EPS bearer context, the network shall not diagnose an error, shall further process the new request and, if it was processed successfully, shall delete the old packet filters which have identical filter precedence values. Furthermore, the network shall perform an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure to deactivate the dedicated EPS bearer context(s) for which it has deleted the packet filters. In case 1, if one or more old packet filters belong to the default EPS bearer context, the network shall release the relevant PDN connection using the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure. If the relevant PDN connection is the last one, the network shall detach the UE using detach type \"re-attach required\". Otherwise the network shall reject the modification request with ESM cause #45 \"syntactical errors in packet filter(s)\". If the ESM cause value is #26 \"insufficient resources\", the network may include a value for timer T3396 value IE in the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message. Upon receipt of a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message, the UE shall stop the timer T3481, release the traffic flow aggregate description associated to the PTI value, and enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE. If the ESM cause included in the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message is #43 \"invalid EPS bearer identity\", the UE locally deactivates the EPS bearer context(s) without peer-to-peer ESM signalling. If the ESM cause value is #26 \"insufficient resources\" and T3396 value IE is included: -\tif the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall start T3396 and not try to send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST messages for the same APN until timer T3396 expires, the timer T3396 is stopped, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed; -\tif the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST messages for the same APN until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed or the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same APN from the network; or -\tif the timer value indicates zero, the UE may send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST messages for the same APN. If the T3396 IE is not included, the UE may send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST messages for the same APN. If the UE is switched off when the timer T3396 is running, the UE behaves as follows when the UE is switched on: -\tlet t1 be the time remaining for T3396 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater than\u00a0t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 \u2013 t. If t1 is equal to or less than t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer with the value t1. The further actions to be performed by the UE are implementation dependent as part of upper layers responsibility.",

These lists can be downloaded by the network to the UE at successful registration and subsequent registration updates. There is only one Local Emergency Numbers List and only one Extended Local Emergency Numbers list in the UE. The Local Emergency Numbers List can be updated with EMM procedures if the UE is in S1 mode, with GMM and MM procedures if the UE is in A/Gb or Iu mode, and with 5GMM procedures, as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54], if UE is in N1 mode. The Extended Local Emergency Numbers List can be updated with EMM procedures if the UE is in S1 mode and with 5GMM procedures, as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54], if UE is in N1 mode. The UE shall use the stored Local Emergency Numbers List and the stored Extended Local Emergency Numbers List received from the network in addition to the emergency numbers stored on the USIM or user equipment to detect that the number dialled is an emergency number. If the UE determines that the number dialled is an emergency number, the procedures specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.167\u00a0[45] and 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.229\u00a0[13D] are utilised to select a domain for the emergency session attempt. If the domain selected for the emergency session attempt is the PS domain, then the UE shall perform the session establishment procedures specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.229\u00a0[13D] to initiate an emergency session. If the domain selected for the emergency session attempt is the CS domain (e.g. the UE has selected GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology), then the UE shall use the stored Local Emergency Numbers List, in addition to the emergency numbers stored on the USIM and the ME, to determine if: -\tthe UE is to send an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message: 1)\tfor CS fallback, indicating \"mobile originating CS fallback or 1xCS fallback\"; or 2)\tfor CS fallback for emergency call, indicating \"mobile originating CS fallback emergency call or 1xCS fallback emergency call\"; and -\tthe call control entity of the UE specified in 3GPP TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13] is to send an EMERGENCY SETUP message or a SETUP message to the network.

Upon expiry of the timer T3245, the UE shall erase the \"forbidden PLMN list\", the \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" list, and the \"forbidden PLMNs for attach in S101 mode\" list and set the USIM to valid for non-EPS and EPS services. When the lists are erased, the UE performs cell selection according to 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.304\u00a0[21]. If the UE is switched off when the timer T3245 is running, the UE shall behave as follows when the UE is switched on and the USIM in the UE remains the same: -\tlet t1 be the time remaining for T3245 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 \u2013 t. If t1 is equal to or less than t, then the UE will follow the behaviour as defined in the paragraph above upon expiry of the timer T3245. If the UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer with the value t1. 5.3.7b\tSpecific requirements for UE when receiving non-integrity protected reject messages This clause specifies the requirements for a UE that is not configured to use timer T3245 (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A] or 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]) and receives an ATTACH REJECT, TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT or SERVICE REJECT message without integrity protection with specific EMM causes. NOTE\u00a01:\tAdditional UE requirements for this case, requirements for other EMM causes, and requirements for the case when the UE receives an integrity protected reject message are specified in clauses\u00a05.5.1, 5.5.3 and 5.6.1. The UE may maintain a list of PLMN-specific attempt counters and a list of PLMN-specific PS-attempt counters (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]). The maximum number of possible entries in each list is implementation dependent. Additionally, the UE may maintain one counter for \"SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services\" events and one counter for \"SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services\" events (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13]). If the UE maintains the above lists of attempt counters and the event counters, a UE supporting N1 mode, shall store them in its non-volatile memory. The UE shall erase the lists and reset the event counters to zero when the UICC containing the USIM is removed. The counter values shall not be affected by the activation or deactivation of power saving mode or MICO mode (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54]).

    "text": "5.3.7a\tSpecific requirements for UE configured to use timer T3245\t88 5.3.7b\tSpecific requirements for UE when receiving non-integrity protected reject messages\t89 The Local Emergency Numbers List and the Extended Local Emergency Numbers list contain additional local emergency numbers used by the serving network. These lists can be downloaded by the network to the UE at successful registration and subsequent registration updates. There is only one Local Emergency Numbers List and only one Extended Local Emergency Numbers list in the UE. The Local Emergency Numbers List can be updated with EMM procedures if the UE is in S1 mode, with GMM and MM procedures if the UE is in A/Gb or Iu mode, and with 5GMM procedures, as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54], if UE is in N1 mode. The Extended Local Emergency Numbers List can be updated with EMM procedures if the UE is in S1 mode and with 5GMM procedures, as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54], if UE is in N1 mode. The UE shall use the stored Local Emergency Numbers List and the stored Extended Local Emergency Numbers List received from the network in addition to the emergency numbers stored on the USIM or user equipment to detect that the number dialled is an emergency number. If the UE determines that the number dialled is an emergency number, the procedures specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.167\u00a0[45] and 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.229\u00a0[13D] are utilised to select a domain for the emergency session attempt. If the domain selected for the emergency session attempt is the PS domain, then the UE shall perform the session establishment procedures specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.229\u00a0[13D] to initiate an emergency session. If the domain selected for the emergency session attempt is the CS domain (e.g. the UE has selected GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology), then the UE shall use the stored Local Emergency Numbers List, in addition to the emergency numbers stored on the USIM and the ME, to determine if: -\tthe UE is to send an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message: 1)\tfor CS fallback, indicating \"mobile originating CS fallback or 1xCS fallback\"; or 2)\tfor CS fallback for emergency call, indicating \"mobile originating CS fallback emergency call or 1xCS fallback emergency call\"; and -\tthe call control entity of the UE specified in 3GPP TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13] is to send an EMERGENCY SETUP message or a SETUP message to the network. NOTE\u00a01:\tThe checking of whether the dialled number is an emergency number and the determination of whether an emergency call is to be initiated in the CS domain, can end once a match is found. The Extended Local Emergency Numbers List does not apply when the CS domain is selected. NOTE\u00a02:\tThe user equipment can use the emergency numbers in each of the stored lists to assist the end user in determining whether the dialled number is intended for an emergency service or for another destination, e.g. a local directory service. The possible interactions with the end user are implementation specific. NOTE\u00a03:\tA UE that supports procedures specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.302\u00a0[48], can get additional local emergency numbers through those procedures, which can be used based on operator policy, see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.302\u00a0[48]. The network may send a Local Emergency Numbers List or an Extended Local Emergency Numbers List or both, in the ATTACH ACCEPT or in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT messages, by including the Emergency number list IE and the Extended emergency number list IE, respectively. The user equipment shall store the Local Emergency Numbers List and the Extended Local Emergency Numbers List, as provided by the network. The Local Emergency Numbers List stored in the user equipment shall be replaced on each receipt of the Emergency number list IE. The Extended Local Emergency Numbers List stored in the user equipment shall be replaced on each receipt of the Extended emergency number list IE. The received Local Emergency Numbers List or the received Extended Local Emergency Numbers list or both shall be provided to the upper layers. The emergency number(s) received in the Emergency number list IE are valid only in networks in the same country as the PLMN from which this IE is received. If no Local Emergency Numbers List is contained in the ATTACH ACCEPT or in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, then the stored Local Emergency Numbers List in the user equipment shall be kept, except if the user equipment has successfully registered to a PLMN in a country different from that of the PLMN that sent the list. The emergency number(s) received in the Extended emergency number list IE are valid only in: -\tnetworks in the same country as the PLMN from which this IE is received, if the Extended Emergency Number List Validity (EENLV) field within the Extended emergency number list IE indicates \"Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is valid in the country of the PLMN from which this IE is received\"; and -\tthe PLMN from which this IE is received, if the EENLV field within the Extended emergency number list IE indicates \"Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is valid only in the PLMN from which this IE is received\". If no Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is contained in the ATTACH ACCEPT or in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and the registered PLMN has not changed, then the stored Extended Local Emergency Numbers List in the user equipment shall be kept. If no Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is contained in the ATTACH ACCEPT or in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, but the registered PLMN has changed, then: -\tif the last received indication in the EENLV field within the Extended emergency number list IE indicates \"Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is valid only in the PLMN from which this IE is received\", the stored Extended Local Emergency Numbers List in the user equipment shall be deleted; and -\tif the last received indication in the EENLV field within the Extended emergency number list IE indicates \"Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is valid in the country of the PLMN from which this IE is received\" the list shall be kept except if the user equipment has successfully registered to a PLMN in a country different from that of the PLMN that sent the list. NOTE:\tTo prevent the misrouting of emergency calls, all operators within a country need to follow the regulation or agree on the setting of the Extended emergency number list IE in accordance to national agreement \u2013 either to indicate validity within a country or to indicate validity only within the PLMN. The Local Emergency Numbers List and the Extended Local Emergency Numbers List shall be deleted at switch off and removal of the USIM. The user equipment shall be able to store up to ten entries in the Local Emergency Numbers List and up to twenty entries in the Extended Local Emergency Numbers List, received from the network. 5.3.7a\tSpecific requirements for UE configured to use timer T3245 The following requirement applies for an UE that is configured to use timer T3245 (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A] or 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]): When the UE adds a PLMN identity to the \"forbidden PLMN list\", the \"forbidden PLMNs for attach in S101 mode\" list, or the \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" list or sets the USIM as invalid for non-EPS services or EPS services or both, and timer T3245 (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13]) is not running, the UE shall start timer T3245 as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13], clause\u00a04.1.1.6. Upon expiry of the timer T3245, the UE shall erase the \"forbidden PLMN list\", the \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" list, and the \"forbidden PLMNs for attach in S101 mode\" list and set the USIM to valid for non-EPS and EPS services. When the lists are erased, the UE performs cell selection according to 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.304\u00a0[21]. If the UE is switched off when the timer T3245 is running, the UE shall behave as follows when the UE is switched on and the USIM in the UE remains the same: -\tlet t1 be the time remaining for T3245 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 \u2013 t. If t1 is equal to or less than t, then the UE will follow the behaviour as defined in the paragraph above upon expiry of the timer T3245. If the UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer with the value t1. 5.3.7b\tSpecific requirements for UE when receiving non-integrity protected reject messages This clause specifies the requirements for a UE that is not configured to use timer T3245 (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A] or 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]) and receives an ATTACH REJECT, TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT or SERVICE REJECT message without integrity protection with specific EMM causes. NOTE\u00a01:\tAdditional UE requirements for this case, requirements for other EMM causes, and requirements for the case when the UE receives an integrity protected reject message are specified in clauses\u00a05.5.1, 5.5.3 and 5.6.1.

The maximum number of possible entries in each list is implementation dependent. Additionally, the UE may maintain one counter for \"SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services\" events and one counter for \"SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services\" events (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13]). If the UE maintains the above lists of attempt counters and the event counters, a UE supporting N1 mode, shall store them in its non-volatile memory. The UE shall erase the lists and reset the event counters to zero when the UICC containing the USIM is removed. The counter values shall not be affected by the activation or deactivation of power saving mode or MICO mode (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54]). If the UE receives an ATTACH REJECT, TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT or SERVICE REJECT message without integrity protection with EMM cause value #3, #6, #7, #8, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #31 or #35 before the network has established secure exchange of NAS messages for the NAS signalling connection, the UE shall start timer T3247 (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13]) with a random value uniformly drawn from the range between 30 minutes and 60 minutes, if the timer is not running, and take the following actions: 1)\tif the EMM cause value received is #3, #6, #7 or #8, and a)\tif the UE maintains a counter for \"SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services\" events and the counter has a value less than a UE implementation-specific maximum value, the UE shall: i)\tset the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to clause\u00a05.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI; -\tif the EMM cause value received is #3, #6 or #8, delete the list of equivalent PLMNs if any; -\tincrement the counter for \"SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services\" events; -\tif the EMM cause value received is #3, #6 or #8, and if the UE maintains a counter for \"SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services\" and the counter has a value less than a UE implementation-specific maximum value, increment the counter; -\tif an attach, tracking area updating or a service request procedure was performed, reset the attach attempt counter, the tracking area updating attempt counter or the service request attempt counter, respectively; -\tif A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, handle the GMM parameters GPRS attach attempt counter, routing area updating attempt counter or service request attempt counter, GMM state, GPRS update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI, GPRS ciphering key sequence number as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.008\u00a0[13] for the case when the GPRS attach, routing area updating or service request procedure is rejected with the GMM cause of the same value in a NAS message without integrity protection; -\tIf the UE is operating in single-registration mode and the EMM cause value received is #3, #6 or #7, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status, registration attempt counter or service request attempt counter, 5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.501\u00a0[54] for the case when the registration request or service request procedure performed over 3GPP access is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same value in a NAS message without integrity protection. -\tIf the UE is operating in single-registration mode and the EMM cause value received is #8, the UE shall in addition set the 5GMM state to 5GMM-DEREGISTERED, the 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, shall reset the registration attempt counter and shall delete any 5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI for 3GPP access. -\tstore the current TAI in the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\", memorize the current TAI was stored in the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" for non-integrity protected NAS reject message and enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE; and -\tsearch for a suitable cell in another tracking area or in another location area according to 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.304\u00a0[21]; or ii)\tproceed as specified in clauses\u00a05.5.1, 5.5.3 and 5.6.1; -\tincrement the counter for \"SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services\" events; and -\tif the EMM cause value received is #3, #6 or #8, and if the UE maintains a counter for \"SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services\" and the counter has a value less than a UE implementation specific maximum value, increment the counter; and b)\telse the UE shall proceed as specified in clauses\u00a05.5.1, 5.5.3 and 5.6.1; 2)\tif the EMM cause value received is #12, #13 or #15, the UE shall additionally proceed as specified in clauses\u00a05.5.1, 5.5.3 and 5.6.1; 3)\tif the EMM cause value received is #11, #14 or #35 and the UE is in its HPLMN or EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present), -\tthe UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store it according to clause\u00a05.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI.

The UE shall not stop timer T3396 upon a PLMN change or inter-system change; ii)\tif the ATTACH REJECT message is integrity protected, the UE shall proceed as follows: a)\tif the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated and an APN was sent by the UE during the attach procedure, the UE shall stop timer T3396 associated with the corresponding APN if it is running. If the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the request type was different from \"emergency\" and from \"handover of emergency bearer services\", and an APN was not sent by the UE during the attach procedure, the UE shall stop timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is running. The UE shall then start timer T3396 with the value provided in the Back-off timer value IE and: -\tshall not initiate a new attach procedure with the same APN or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST with the same APN that was sent by the UE, until timer T3396 expires or timer T3396 is stopped; and -\tshall not initiate a new attach procedure without an APN and with request type different from \"emergency\" and from \"handover of emergency bearer services\" or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST without an APN and with request type different from \"emergency\" and from \"handover of emergency bearer services\", if the UE did not provide any APN during the attach procedure and the request type was different from \"emergency\" and from \"handover of emergency bearer services\", until timer T3396 expires. The UE shall not stop timer T3396 upon a PLMN change or inter-system change; b)\tif the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE: -\tshall not initiate a new attach procedure with the same APN or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST with the same APN that was sent by the UE, until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message for the same APN from the network; and -\tshall not initiate a new attach procedure without an APN and with request type different from \"emergency\" and from \"handover of emergency bearer services\" or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST without an APN and with request type different from \"emergency\" and from \"handover of emergency bearer services\", if the UE did not provide any APN during the attach procedure and the request type was different from \"emergency\" and from \"handover of emergency bearer services\", until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN provided by the UE. The timer T3396 remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system change; and c)\tif the timer value indicates that this timer is zero, the UE shall proceed as specified in clause 5.5.1.2.6 item d. If the Back-off timer value IE is not included and the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST was sent standalone, then the UE may send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the same APN as specified in clause\u00a06.3.5. When the timer T3396 is running or the timer is deactivated, the UE is allowed to initiate an attach procedure or PDN connectivity procedure if the procedure is for emergency bearer services. If the timer T3396 is running when the UE enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE remains the same, then timer T3396 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped. If the UE is switched off when the timer T3396 is running, and if the USIM in the UE remains the same when the UE is switched on, the UE shall behave as follows: -\tlet t1 be the time remaining for T3396 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 \u2013 t. If t1 is equal to or less than t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer with the value t1; -\tif prior to switch off, timer T3396 was running for a specific APN, because a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message containing the low priority indicator set to \"MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority\" was rejected with a timer value for timer T3396, and if timer T3396 is restarted at switch on, then the UE configured for dual priority shall handle session management requests as indicated in clause\u00a06.5.5; and -\tif prior to switch off timer T3396 was running because a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST without APN sent together with an ATTACH REQUEST message containing the low priority indicator set to \"MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority\" was rejected with a timer value for timer T3396, and if timer T3396 is restarted at switch on, then the UE configured for dual priority shall handle session management requests as indicated in clause\u00a06.5.5.",

The UE supporting WUS assistance may include its UE paging probability information in the Requested WUS assistance information IE during an attach or tracking area updating procedure (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10]). The UE shall not include its UE paging probability information during: -\tan attach for emergency bearer services procedure; or -\ta tracking area updating procedure for the UE attached for emergency bearer services. The UE and the network may negotiate the UE paging probability information during an attach or tracking area updating procedure when the UE is not attached for emergency bearer services. The UE paging probability information is an assistance information used to determine the WUS group for paging UE (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10], 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.300\u00a0[20]). NOTE:\tThe determination of UE paging probability information is up to UE implementation. If the UE is not attached for emergency bearer services and the network accepts the use of the WUS assistance for the UE, the network determines the negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE based on the requested UE paging probability information, if any, local configuration or previous statistical information for the UE, and then indicates the negotiated UE paging probability information in the Negotiated WUS assistance information IE to the UE when accepting the attach or the tracking area updating procedure. The network shall store the negotiated UE paging probability information in the EMM context of the UE for paging. The UE shall use WUS assistance only if it received the Negotiated WUS assistance information IE during the last attach or tracking area updating procedure. If the UE did not receive the Negotiated WUS assistance information IE during the last attach or tracking area updating procedure, the UE shall not use WUS assistance. If the network did not accept the request to use WUS assistance, the network shall delete the stored negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE, if available. When a PDN connection for emergency bearer service is successfully established after the UE received the Negotiated WUS assistance information IE during the last attach or tracking area updating procedure, the UE and the network shall not use WUS assistance information until: -\tthe successful completion of the PDN disconnect procedure of the PDN connection for emergency bearer services or EPS bearer context deactivation procedure of the EPS bearer context for emergency, or -\tthe UE receives WUS assistance information during a tracking area updating procedure with EPS bearer context synchronization or upon successful completion of a service request procedure, if the UE or the network locally releases the PDN connection for emergency bearer service.",

    "text": "UE radio capability signalling optimisation (RACS) is a feature that is optional at both the UE and the network and which aims to optimise the transmission of UE radio capability over the radio interface (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.401\u00a0[10]). RACS works by assigning an identifier to represent a set of UE radio capabilities. This identifier is called the UE radio capability ID. A UE radio capability ID can be either manufacturer-assigned or network-assigned. The UE radio capability ID is an alternative to the signalling of the radio capabilities container over the radio interface. In this release of the specification, RACS is not applicable to NB-S1 mode. If the UE supports RACS: -\tthe UE shall indicate support for RACS by setting the RACS bit to \"RACS supported\" in the UE network capability IE of the ATTACH REQUEST and TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST messages; -\tif the UE performs an attach procedure and the UE has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the current UE radio configuration in the selected network, the UE shall include the UE radio capability ID availability IE in the ATTACH REQUEST message and set the IE to \"UE radio capability ID available\"; -\tif the UE performs a tracking area updating procedure and the UE has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the current UE radio configuration in the selected network, the UE shall include the UE radio capability ID availability IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and set the IE to \"UE radio capability ID available\"; -\tIf the UE is requested to provide the UE radio capability ID by the network during a security mode control procedure, the UE shall include the UE radio capability ID in the UE radio capability ID IE of the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message according to the rules in clause 5.4.3.3.; -\tif the radio configuration at the UE changes (for instance because the UE has disabled a specific radio capability) then: a)\tif the UE has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the new UE radio configuration, the UE shall initiate a tracking area updating procedure, include a UE radio capability information update needed IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and set the URCIDA bit to \"UE radio capability ID available\" in the UE radio capability ID availability IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message; and b)\tif the UE does not have an applicable UE radio capability ID for the new UE radio configuration, the UE shall initiate a tracking area updating procedure and shall include a UE radio capability information update needed IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message; NOTE:\tPerforming the tracking area updating procedure with the UE radio capability information update needed IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and without the UE radio capability ID availability IE set to \"UE radio capability ID available\" in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message as specified in b) above can trigger the network to assign a new UE radio capability ID to the UE. -\tupon receiving a network-assigned UE radio capability ID in the ATTACH ACCEPT message, in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message or in the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message, the UE shall store the network-assigned UE radio capability ID and the PLMN ID of the serving network along with a mapping to the current UE radio configuration in its non-volatile memory as specified in annex\u00a0C. The UE shall be able to store at least the last 16 received network-assigned UE radio capability IDs with the associated PLMN ID and the mapping to the corresponding UE radio configuration; -\tthe UE shall not use a network-assigned UE radio capability ID in PLMNs equivalent to the PLMN which assigned it; and -\tupon receiving a UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE set to \"Network-assigned UE radio capability IDs deletion requested\" in the ATTACH ACCEPT message, in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message or in the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message, the UE shall delete all network-assigned UE radio capability IDs stored at the UE for the serving network and initiate a tracking area updating procedure. If the UE has an applicable manufacturer-assigned UE radio capability ID for the current UE radio configuration in the selected network, the UE shall include a UE radio capability ID availability IE set to \"UE radio capability ID available\" in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

Exceptions are described in the corresponding procedure description. \u0007 \u0007 Annex A (informative): Cause values for EPS mobility management A.1\tCauses related to UE identification Cause #2 \u2013 IMSI unknown in HSS This EMM cause is sent to the UE if the UE is not known (registered) in the HSS. This EMM cause does not affect operation of the EPS service, although is may be used by an EMM procedure. Cause #3 \u2013 Illegal UE This EMM cause is sent to the UE when the network refuses service to the UE either because an identity of the UE is not acceptable to the network or because the UE does not pass the authentication check, i.e. the RES received from the UE is different from that generated by the network. Cause #6 \u2013 Illegal ME This EMM cause is sent to the UE if the ME used is not acceptable to the network, e.g. blacklisted. Cause #9 \u2013 UE identity cannot be derived by the network. This EMM cause is sent to the UE when the network cannot derive the UE's identity from the GUTI/S-TMSI/P-TMSI and RAI e.g. no matching identity/context in the network or failure to validate the UE's identity due to integrity check failure of the received message. Cause #10 \u2013 Implicitly detached This EMM cause is sent to the UE either if the network has implicitly detached the UE, e.g. after the implicit detach timer has expired, or if the EMM context data related to the subscription does not exist in the MME e.g. because of a MME restart. A.2\tCause related to subscription options Cause #5 \u2013 IMEI not accepted This cause is sent to the UE if the network does not accept an attach procedure for emergency bearer services using an IMEI. Cause #7 \u2013 EPS services not allowed This EMM cause is sent to the UE when it is not allowed to operate EPS services. Cause #8 \u2013 EPS services and non-EPS services not allowed This EMM cause is sent to the UE when it is not allowed to operate either EPS or non-EPS services. Cause #11 \u2013 PLMN not allowed This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests attach or tracking area updating in a PLMN where the UE, by subscription or due to operator determined barring, is not allowed to operate. Cause #12 \u2013 Tracking area not allowed This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests tracking area updating in a tracking area where the HPLMN determines that the UE, by subscription, is not allowed to operate. NOTE\u00a01:\tIf EMM cause #12 is sent to a roaming subscriber the subscriber is denied service even if other PLMNs are available on which registration was possible. Cause #13 \u2013 Roaming not allowed in this tracking area This EMM cause is sent to an UE which requests tracking area updating in a tracking area of a PLMN which by subscription offers roaming to that UE but not in that tracking area. Cause #14 \u2013 EPS services not allowed in this PLMN This EMM cause is sent to the UE which requests EPS service in a PLMN which does not offer roaming for EPS services to that UE. NOTE\u00a02:\tSince only one list of forbidden PLMNs for packet services is maintained in the UE, then the \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" is the maintained list and the forbidden PLMNs for EPS service is equivalent to it. Cause #15 \u2013 No suitable cells in tracking area This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests tracking area updating in a tracking area where the UE, by subscription, is not allowed to operate, but when it should find another allowed tracking area in the same PLMN. NOTE\u00a03:\tCause #15 and cause #12 differ in the fact that cause #12 does not trigger the UE to search for another allowed tracking area on the same PLMN. Cause #25 \u2013 Not authorized for this CSG This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests access in a CSG cell with CSG ID where the UE either has no subscription to operate or the UE's subscription has expired and it should find another cell in the same PLMN. Cause #35 \u2013 Requested service option not authorized in this PLMN This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests in a PLMN a service option for which it is not authorized, e.g. if it attempts to attach for relay node operation in a PLMN with a USIM which does not belong to a relay node-specific subscription. Cause #40 \u2013 No EPS bearer context activated This EMM cause is sent to the UE, if during a tracking area updating procedure or when receiving a service request for CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, the MME detects that there is no active EPS bearer context in the\u00a0network. A.3\tCauses related to PLMN specific network failures and congestion/authentication failures Cause #16 \u2013 MSC temporarily not reachable This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests a combined EPS attach or tracking area updating in a PLMN where the MSC is temporarily not reachable via the EPS part of the network. Cause #17 \u2013 Network failure This EMM cause is sent to the UE if the MME cannot service an UE generated request because of PLMN failures. Cause #18 \u2013 CS domain not available This EMM cause is sent to the UE if the MME cannot service an UE generated request because of no availability of CS domain. Cause #19 \u2013 ESM failure This EMM cause is sent to the UE when there is a failure in the ESM message contained in the EMM message. Cause #20 \u2013 MAC failure This EMM cause is sent to the network if the USIM detects that the MAC in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message is not fresh (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19]). Cause #21 \u2013 Synch failure This EMM cause is sent to the network if the USIM detects that the SQN in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message is out of range (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19]). Cause #22 \u2013 Congestion This EMM cause is sent to the UE because of congestion in the network (e.g. no channel, facility busy/congested etc.). Cause #23 \u2013 UE security capabilities mismatch This EMM cause is sent to the network if the UE detects that the UE security capability does not match the one sent back by the network. Cause #24 \u2013 Security mode rejected, unspecified This EMM cause is sent to the network if the security mode command is rejected by the UE if the UE detects that the nonceUE does not match the one sent back by the network or for unspecified reasons. Cause #26 \u2013 Non-EPS authentication unacceptable This EMM cause is sent to the network in S1 mode if the \"separation bit\" in the AMF field of AUTN is set to 0 in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19]). Cause #39 \u2013 CS service temporarily not available This EMM cause is sent to the UE when the CS fallback or 1xCS fallback request cannot be served temporarily due to O&M reasons or a mobile terminating CS fallback call is aborted by the network during call establishment (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.118\u00a0[16A]).

Cause #51 \u2013 PDN type IPv6 only allowed This ESM cause is used by the network to indicate that only PDN type IPv6 is allowed for the requested PDN connectivity. Cause #52 \u2013 single address bearers only allowed This ESM cause is used by the network to indicate that the requested PDN connectivity is accepted with the restriction that only single IP version bearers are allowed. Cause #53 \u2013 ESM information not received This ESM cause is used by the network to indicate that the PDN connectivity procedure was rejected due to the ESM information was not received. Cause #54 \u2013 PDN connection does not exist This ESM cause is used by the network at handover from a non-3GPP access network to indicate that the MME does not have any information about the requested PDN connection. Cause #55 \u2013 Multiple PDN connections for a given APN not allowed This ESM cause is used by the network to indicate that the PDN connectivity procedure was rejected due to multiple PDN connections for a given APN are not allowed. Cause #56 \u2013 Collision with network initiated request This ESM cause is used by the network to indicate that the network has already initiated the activation, modification or deactivation of bearer resources which was requested by the UE. Cause #59 \u2013 Unsupported QCI value This ESM cause is used by the network if the QCI indicated in the UE request cannot be supported.

Cause #97 \u2013 Message type non-existent or not implemented This ESM cause indicates that the equipment sending this ESM cause has received a message with a message type it does not recognize either because this is a message not defined, or defined but not implemented by the equipment sending this ESM cause. Cause #98 \u2013 Message type not compatible with protocol state This ESM cause indicates that the equipment sending this ESM cause has received a message not compatible with the protocol state. Cause #99 \u2013 Information element non-existent or not implemented This ESM cause indicates that the equipment sending this ESM cause has received a message which includes information elements not recognized because the information element identifier is not defined or it is defined but not implemented by the equipment sending the ESM cause. However, the information element is not required to be present in the message in order for the equipment sending the ESM cause to process the message. Cause #100 \u2013 Conditional IE error This ESM cause indicates that the equipment sending this cause has received a message with conditional IE errors. Cause #101 \u2013 Message not compatible with protocol state This ESM cause indicates that a message has been received which is incompatible with the protocol state. Cause #111 \u2013 Protocol error, unspecified This ESM cause is used to report a protocol error event only when no other ESM cause in the protocol error class applies. Annex C (normative): Storage of EMM information The following EMM parameters shall be stored on the USIM if the corresponding file is present: -\tGUTI; -\tlast visited registered TAI; -\tEPS update status; -\tAllowed CSG list; -\tOperator CSG list; and -\tEPS security context parameters from a full native EPS security context (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19]). The presence and format of corresponding files on the USIM is specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]. If the corresponding file is not present on the USIM, these EMM parameters except allowed CSG list are stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME together with the IMSI from the USIM. The allowed CSG list is stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME if the UE supports CSG selection. These EMM parameters can only be used if the IMSI from the USIM matches the IMSI stored in the non-volatile memory; else the UE shall delete the EMM parameters. The following EMM parameter shall be stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME together with the IMSI from the USIM: -\tTIN. This EMM parameter can only be used if the IMSI from the USIM matches the IMSI stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME; else the UE shall delete the EMM parameter. If the UE is attached for emergency bearer services, the UE shall not store the EMM parameters described in this annex on the USIM or in non-volatile memory. Instead the UE shall temporarily store these parameters locally in the ME and the UE shall delete these parameters when the UE is detached. Annex D (normative): Establishment cause (S1 mode only) D.1\tMapping of NAS procedure to RRC establishment cause (S1 mode only) When EMM requests the establishment of a NAS-signalling connection, the RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected according to the NAS procedure as specified in table\u00a0D.1.1. The EMM shall also indicate to the lower layer for the purpose of access control, the call type associated with the RRC establishment cause as specified in table\u00a0D.1.1.

For this purpose the home country is defined as the country of the MCC part of the IMSI, see 3GPP\u00a0TS 22.011\u00a0[1A]. For these NAS procedures initiated by UE of access class 11 or 15 in their HPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty) or EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present), the RRC establishment cause will be set to \"High priority access AC 11 \u2013 15\". Note 2:\tThis is not applicable for mobile terminating 1xCS fallback. \u0007 \u0007 NOTE:\tThe RRC establishment cause can be used by the network to prioritise the connection establishment request from the UE at high load situations in the network.

Should the TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as follows: Version x.y.z where: x\tthe first digit: Table 10.3.1: EPS session management timers \u2013 UE side NOTE\u00a01:\tThe back-off timer is used to describe a logical model of the required UE behaviour. This model does not imply any specific implementation, e.g. as a timer or timestamp. NOTE\u00a02:\tReference to back-off timer in this section can either refer to use of timer T3396 or to use of a different packet system specific timer within the UE. Whether the UE uses T3396 as a back-off timer or it uses different packet system specific timers as back-off timers is left up to UE implementation. Table 10.3.2: EPS session management timers \u2013 network side Annex A (informative):\nCause values for EPS mobility management A.1\tCauses related to UE identification Cause #2 \u2013 IMSI unknown in HSS This EMM cause is sent to the UE if the UE is not known (registered) in the HSS or if the UE has packet only subscription. This EMM cause does not affect operation of the EPS service, although it may be used by an EMM procedure. Cause #3 \u2013 Illegal UE This EMM cause is sent to the UE when the network refuses service to the UE either because an identity of the UE is not acceptable to the network or because the UE does not pass the authentication check, i.e. the RES received from the UE is different from that generated by the network. Cause #6 \u2013 Illegal ME This EMM cause is sent to the UE if the ME used is not acceptable to the network, e.g. on the prohibited list. Cause #9 \u2013 UE identity cannot be derived by the network. This EMM cause is sent to the UE when the network cannot derive the UE's identity from the GUTI/S-TMSI/P-TMSI and RAI e.g. no matching identity/context in the network or failure to validate the UE's identity due to integrity check failure of the received message. Cause #10 \u2013 Implicitly detached This EMM cause is sent to the UE either if the network has implicitly detached the UE, e.g. after the implicit detach timer has expired, or if the EMM context data related to the subscription does not exist in the MME e.g. because of a MME restart, or because of a periodic tracking area update request routed to a new MME. A.2\tCause related to subscription options Cause #5 \u2013 IMEI not accepted This cause is sent to the UE if the network does not accept an attach procedure for emergency bearer services using an IMEI. Cause #7 \u2013 EPS services not allowed This EMM cause is sent to the UE when it is not allowed to operate EPS services. Cause #8 \u2013 EPS services and non-EPS services not allowed This EMM cause is sent to the UE when it is not allowed to operate either EPS or non-EPS services. Cause #11 \u2013 PLMN not allowed This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests service, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a PLMN where the UE, by subscription or due to operator determined barring, is not allowed to operate. Cause #12 \u2013 Tracking area not allowed This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests service, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a tracking area where the HPLMN determines that the UE, by subscription, is not allowed to operate. NOTE\u00a01:\tIf EMM cause #12 is sent to a roaming subscriber the subscriber is denied service even if other PLMNs are available on which registration was possible. Cause #13 \u2013 Roaming not allowed in this tracking area This EMM cause is sent to an UE which requests service, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a tracking area of a PLMN which by subscription offers roaming to that UE but not in that tracking area. Cause #14 \u2013 EPS services not allowed in this PLMN This EMM cause is sent to the UE which requests service, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a PLMN which does not offer roaming for EPS services to that UE. NOTE\u00a02:\tSince only one list of forbidden PLMNs for packet services is maintained in the UE, then the \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" is the maintained list and the forbidden PLMNs for EPS service is equivalent to it. Cause #15 \u2013 No suitable cells in tracking area This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests service, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a tracking area where the UE, by subscription, is not allowed to operate, but when it should find another allowed tracking area or location area in the same PLMN or an equivalent PLMN. NOTE\u00a03:\tCause #15 and cause #12 differ in the fact that cause #12 does not trigger the UE to search for another allowed tracking area on the same PLMN. Cause #25 \u2013 Not authorized for this CSG This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests access, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a CSG cell with CSG ID where the UE either has no subscription to operate or the UE's subscription has expired and it should find another cell in the same PLMN or an equivalent PLMN. Cause #35 \u2013 Requested service option not authorized in this PLMN This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests in a PLMN a service option for which it is not authorized, e.g. if it attempts to attach for relay node operation in a PLMN with a USIM which does not belong to a relay node-specific subscription. Cause #36 \u2013 IAB-node operation not authorized This EMM cause is sent to the UE if a UE operating as an IAB-node requests service, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a PLMN where the UE, by subscription, is not authorized for IAB operation. Cause #40 \u2013 No EPS bearer context activated This EMM cause is sent to the UE, if during a tracking area updating procedure or a service request, the MME detects that there is no active EPS bearer context in the\u00a0network. Cause #31 \u2013 Redirection to 5GCN required This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests service in a PLMN where the UE by operator policy, is not allowed in EPC and redirection to 5GCN is required. A.3\tCauses related to PLMN specific network failures and congestion/authentication failures Cause #16 \u2013 MSC temporarily not reachable This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests a combined EPS attach or tracking area updating in a PLMN where the MSC is temporarily not reachable via the EPS part of the network. Cause #17 \u2013 Network failure This EMM cause is sent to the UE if the MME cannot service an UE generated request because of PLMN failures. Cause #18 \u2013 CS domain not available This EMM cause is sent to the UE if the MME cannot service an UE generated request because CS domain is not available and SMS in MME is not supported. Cause #19 \u2013 ESM failure This EMM cause is sent to the UE when there is a failure in the ESM message contained in the EMM message. Cause #20 \u2013 MAC failure This EMM cause is sent to the network if the USIM detects that the MAC in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message is not fresh (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19]). Cause #21 \u2013 Synch failure This EMM cause is sent to the network if the USIM detects that the SQN in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message is out of range (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19]). Cause #22 \u2013 Congestion This EMM cause is sent to the UE because of congestion in the network (e.g. no channel, facility busy/congested etc.). Cause #23 \u2013 UE security capabilities mismatch This EMM cause is sent to the network if the UE detects that the UE security capability does not match the one sent back by the network. Cause #24 \u2013 Security mode rejected, unspecified This EMM cause is sent to the network if the security mode command is rejected by the UE if the UE detects that the nonceUE does not match the one sent back by the network or for unspecified reasons. Cause #26 \u2013 Non-EPS authentication unacceptable This EMM cause is sent to the network in S1 mode if the \"separation bit\" in the AMF field of AUTN is set to 0 in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19]). Cause #39 \u2013 CS service temporarily not available This EMM cause is sent to the UE when the CS fallback or 1xCS fallback request cannot be served temporarily due to O&M reasons or a mobile terminating CS fallback call is aborted by the network during call establishment (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.118\u00a0[]). Cause #42 \u2013 Severe network failure This EMM cause is sent to the UE when the network has determined that the requested procedure cannot be completed successfully due to network failure. The failure is not expected to be temporary and repeated request is not likely to succeed in near future. Cause #78 \u2013PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE location This EMM cause is sent to the UE to indicate that the PLMN is not allowed to operate at the present UE location. NOTE:\tThis cause is only used by the network towards UE in NB-S1 mode or WB-S1 mode accessing the network through a satellite E-UTRA cell. A.4\tCauses related to nature of request NOTE:\tThis clause has no entries in this version of the specification A.5\tCauses related to invalid messages Cause value #95 \u2013 Semantically incorrect message.

Cause #43 \u2013 Invalid EPS bearer identity This ESM cause is used by the network or the UE to indicate that the EPS bearer identity value provided to it is not a valid value for the received message or the EPS bearer context identified by the linked EPS bearer identity IE in the request is not active. Cause #44 \u2013 Semantic errors in packet filter(s) This ESM cause is used by the network or the UE to indicate that the requested service was rejected due to one or more semantic errors in packet filter(s) of the TFT included in the request. Cause #45 \u2013 Syntactical error in packet filter(s) This ESM cause is used by the network or the UE to indicate that the requested service was rejected due to one or more syntactical errors in packet filter(s) of the TFT included in the request. Cause #47 \u2013 PTI mismatch This ESM cause is used by the UE to indicate that the PTI value which is included in the ESM message that the UE receives does not match a PTI in use. Cause #49 \u2013 Last PDN disconnection not allowed This ESM cause is used by the network, in case of EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, to indicate that the UE requested PDN disconnection procedure on the last remaining PDN connection is not allowed.

Cause #99 \u2013 Information element non-existent or not implemented This ESM cause indicates that the equipment sending this ESM cause has received a message which includes information elements not recognized because the information element identifier is not defined or it is defined but not implemented by the equipment sending the ESM cause. However, the information element is not required to be present in the message in order for the equipment sending the ESM cause to process the message. Cause #100 \u2013 Conditional IE error This ESM cause indicates that the equipment sending this cause has received a message with conditional IE errors. Cause #101 \u2013 Message not compatible with protocol state This ESM cause indicates that a message has been received which is incompatible with the protocol state.

Annex C (normative):\nStorage of EMM information The following EMM parameters shall be stored on the USIM if the corresponding file is present: -\tGUTI; -\tlast visited registered TAI; -\tEPS update status; -\tAllowed CSG list; -\tOperator CSG list; and -\tEPS security context parameters from a full native EPS security context (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19]). The presence and format of corresponding files on the USIM is specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]. If the corresponding file is not present on the USIM, these EMM parameters except allowed CSG list are stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME together with the IMSI from the USIM. The allowed CSG list is stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME if the UE supports CSG selection. These EMM parameters can only be used if the IMSI from the USIM matches the IMSI stored in the non-volatile memory; else the UE shall delete the EMM parameters. The following EMM parameters shall be stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME together with the IMSI from the USIM: -\tTIN; -\tDCN-ID list; and -\tnetwork-assigned UE radio capability IDs. The TIN parameter can only be used if the IMSI from the USIM matches the IMSI stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME; else the UE shall delete the TIN parameter. The DCN-ID list consists of DCN-IDs stored together with a PLMN identity. The list can have zero or more entries and the maximum length shall be at least 32 entries. When the maximum length is reached any new entry shall replace the oldest entry in the list. There shall be no duplicated PLMN identities in the list and any existing DCN-ID shall be deleted when a new DCN-ID is added for the same PLMN. The DCN-ID list can only be used if the IMSI from the USIM matches the IMSI stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME; else the UE shall delete the DCN-ID list. The UE shall delete the stored DCN-ID list if the default standardized DCN-ID in the UE is changed. Each network-assigned UE radio capability ID is stored together with a PLMN identity of the PLMN that provided it as well as a mapping to the corresponding UE radio configuration, and is valid in that PLMN. A network-assigned UE radio capability ID can only be used if the IMSI from the USIM matches the IMSI stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME, else the UE shall delete the network-assigned UE radio capability ID. The UE shall be able to store at least the last 16 received network-assigned UE radio capability IDs. There shall be only one network-assigned UE radio capability ID stored for a given combination of PLMN identity and UE radio configuration and any existing UE radio capability ID shall be deleted when a new UE radio capability ID is added for the same combination of PLMN identity and UE radio configuration. If the UE receives a network-assigned UE radio capability ID with a Version ID value different from the value included in the network-assigned UE radio capability ID(s) stored at the UE for the serving PLMN, the UE may delete these stored network-assigned UE radio capability ID(s). If the UE is attached for emergency bearer services, the UE shall not store the EMM parameters described in this annex on the USIM or in non-volatile memory. Instead the UE shall temporarily store these parameters locally in the ME and the UE shall delete these parameters when the UE is detached. If the UE is configured for eCall only mode as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17], the UE shall not store the EMM parameters described in this annex on the USIM or in non-volatile memory. Instead the UE shall temporarily store these parameters locally in the ME and the UE shall delete these parameters when the UE enters EMM-DEREGISTERED.eCALL-INACTIVE state, the UE is switched-off or the USIM is removed. If the UE is attached for access to RLOS, the UE shall not store the EMM parameters described in this annex on the USIM or in non-volatile memory. Instead, the UE shall temporarily store these parameters locally in the ME and the UE shall delete these parameters after detach. Annex D (normative):\nEstablishment cause (S1 mode only) D.1\tMapping of NAS procedure to RRC establishment cause (S1 mode only) When EMM requests the establishment of a NAS-signalling connection, or when EMM requests the lower layers to resume a NAS signalling connection, the RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected according to the NAS procedure as specified in table\u00a0D.1.1. The EMM shall also indicate to the lower layer for the purpose of access control, the call type associated with the RRC establishment cause as specified in table\u00a0D.1.1. If the UE is configured for EAB (see the \"ExtendedAccessBarring\" leaf of NAS configuration MO in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A] or 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]), the EMM shall indicate to the lower layer for the purpose of access control that EAB applies for this request except for the following cases: -\tthe UE is a UE configured to use AC11 \u2013 15 in selected PLMN; -\tthe UE is answering to paging; -\tthe RRC Establishment cause is set to \"Emergency call\"; -\tthe UE is configured to allow overriding EAB (see the \"Override_ExtendedAccessBarring\" leaf of the NAS configuration MO as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A] or 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]) and receives an indication from the upper layers to override EAB; or -\tthe UE is configured to allow overriding EAB (see the \"Override_ExtendedAccessBarring\" leaf of the NAS configuration MO as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A] or 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]) and already has a PDN connection that was established with EAB override. Table D.1.1: Mapping of NAS procedure to establishment cause and call type NOTE:\tThe RRC establishment cause can be used by the network to prioritise the connection establishment request from the UE at high load situations in the network. Annex E (informative):\nGuidelines for enhancements to MS network capability IE and UE network capability IE The UE uses the information elements MS network capability and UE network capability to inform the core network about its network related capabilities. Both information elements can be signalled in any of the modes: A/Gb mode, Iu mode and S1 mode. The purpose of the present annex is to give some guidelines how to select the information element(s) to be enhanced if new capabilities need to be added. 1)\tIf a capability is related to a feature that can be used in a network supporting A/Gb mode only or Iu mode only or both, the capability will be signalled in the MS network capability IE. 2)\tIf a capability is related to a feature that can be used in network supporting S1 mode only, the capability will be signalled in the UE network capability IE. 3)\tIf a capability is related to a feature that can be used only in a network supporting both S1 mode and at least one of the two modes A/Gb mode and Iu mode, the capability is added only to one of the two information elements: a)\tIf the information is used by the MME only, the capability will be signalled in the UE network capability IE. b)\tIf the information is used by the SGSN only or both by the SGSN and by the MME, the capability will be signalled in the MS network capability IE. NOTE:\tThe reason for rules 1 and 2 is that a UE not supporting A/Gb mode and Iu mode will not provide the MS network capability IE to the network and a UE not supporting S1 mode will not provide the UE network capability IE. In some cases, due to rules 1 and 2 the capability indicator will be included in both information elements. EXAMPLE\u00a01:\tThe support indicator for UCS2 is included in both information elements. EXAMPLE\u00a02:\tThe \"SRVCC to GERAN/UTRAN capability\" is included in the MS network capability IE, as it is used both by the MME for SRVCC from E-UTRAN to GERAN/UTRAN and by the SGSN for SRVCC from UTRAN HSPA to GERAN/UTRAN. Annex F (normative):\nApplication specific Congestion control for Data Communication (ACDC) The UE may support the procedures in this annex. If the UE supports ACDC, the EMM layer shall determine the ACDC category applicable to the request based on the application identifier received from the upper layers and the configuration information in the \"ACDCConf\" leaf of ACDC MO as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.105\u00a0[35] or in the USIM EFACDC as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]. NOTE\u00a01:\tAs an implementation option, the upper layers can determine the ACDC category and send it to the EMM layer. Then the EMM layer need not read the ACDC MO or USIM to determine the ACDC category. The EMM sublayer shall indicate to the lower layers, for the purpose of access control: -\tthe ACDC category that applies to this request if only one ACDC category is applicable; -\tthe highest ranked ACDC category among the ACDC categories that applies to this request if multiple ACDC categories are applicable; or -\tthis request is for an uncategorized application if an application identifier received from the upper layers is not mapped to any ACDC category, except for the following cases: -\tthe UE is a UE configured to use AC11 \u2013 15 in selected PLMN; -\tthe UE is answering to paging; -\tthe RRC Establishment cause is set to \"Emergency call\"; or -\tif conditions MO MMTEL voice call is started or MO MMTEL video call is started or MO SMSoIP is started, is satisfied. NOTE\u00a02:\tThe request from the EMM sublayer refers to either a request to establish an initial NAS signalling connection or a request to re-establish a NAS signalling connection. If the UE supports ACDC and access is barred because of ACDC, the EMM layer shall keep track of the ACDC category for which access is barred and it shall not send a request for the same ACDC category or a lower ACDC category until access is granted. If the UE supports ACDC and access is barred because of ACDC, the EMM layer shall not send a request for any uncategorized application until access is granted.

This model does not imply any specific implementation, e.g. as a timer or timestamp. NOTE\u00a02:\tReference to back-off timer in this section can either refer to use of timer T3396 or to use of a different packet system specific timer within the UE. Whether the UE uses T3396 as a back-off timer or it uses different packet system specific timers as back-off timers is left up to UE implementation. Table 10.3.2: EPS session management timers \u2013 network side Annex A (informative):\nCause values for EPS mobility management A.1\tCauses related to UE identification Cause #2 \u2013 IMSI unknown in HSS This EMM cause is sent to the UE if the UE is not known (registered) in the HSS or if the UE has packet only subscription. This EMM cause does not affect operation of the EPS service, although it may be used by an EMM procedure. Cause #3 \u2013 Illegal UE This EMM cause is sent to the UE when the network refuses service to the UE either because an identity of the UE is not acceptable to the network or because the UE does not pass the authentication check, i.e. the RES received from the UE is different from that generated by the network. Cause #6 \u2013 Illegal ME This EMM cause is sent to the UE if the ME used is not acceptable to the network, e.g. on the prohibited list. Cause #9 \u2013 UE identity cannot be derived by the network. This EMM cause is sent to the UE when the network cannot derive the UE's identity from the GUTI/S-TMSI/P-TMSI and RAI e.g. no matching identity/context in the network or failure to validate the UE's identity due to integrity check failure of the received message. Cause #10 \u2013 Implicitly detached This EMM cause is sent to the UE either if the network has implicitly detached the UE, e.g. after the implicit detach timer has expired, or if the EMM context data related to the subscription does not exist in the MME e.g. because of a MME restart, or because of a periodic tracking area update request routed to a new MME. A.2\tCause related to subscription options Cause #5 \u2013 IMEI not accepted This cause is sent to the UE if the network does not accept an attach procedure for emergency bearer services using an IMEI. Cause #7 \u2013 EPS services not allowed This EMM cause is sent to the UE when it is not allowed to operate EPS services. Cause #8 \u2013 EPS services and non-EPS services not allowed This EMM cause is sent to the UE when it is not allowed to operate either EPS or non-EPS services. Cause #11 \u2013 PLMN not allowed This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests service, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a PLMN where the UE, by subscription or due to operator determined barring, is not allowed to operate. Cause #12 \u2013 Tracking area not allowed This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests service, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a tracking area where the HPLMN determines that the UE, by subscription, is not allowed to operate. NOTE\u00a01:\tIf EMM cause #12 is sent to a roaming subscriber the subscriber is denied service even if other PLMNs are available on which registration was possible. Cause #13 \u2013 Roaming not allowed in this tracking area This EMM cause is sent to an UE which requests service, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a tracking area of a PLMN which by subscription offers roaming to that UE but not in that tracking area. Cause #14 \u2013 EPS services not allowed in this PLMN This EMM cause is sent to the UE which requests service, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a PLMN which does not offer roaming for EPS services to that UE. NOTE\u00a02:\tSince only one list of forbidden PLMNs for packet services is maintained in the UE, then the \"forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service\" is the maintained list and the forbidden PLMNs for EPS service is equivalent to it. Cause #15 \u2013 No suitable cells in tracking area This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests service, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a tracking area where the UE, by subscription, is not allowed to operate, but when it should find another allowed tracking area or location area in the same PLMN or an equivalent PLMN. NOTE\u00a03:\tCause #15 and cause #12 differ in the fact that cause #12 does not trigger the UE to search for another allowed tracking area on the same PLMN. Cause #25 \u2013 Not authorized for this CSG This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests access, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a CSG cell with CSG ID where the UE either has no subscription to operate or the UE's subscription has expired and it should find another cell in the same PLMN or an equivalent PLMN. Cause #35 \u2013 Requested service option not authorized in this PLMN This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests in a PLMN a service option for which it is not authorized, e.g. if it attempts to attach for relay node operation in a PLMN with a USIM which does not belong to a relay node-specific subscription. Cause #36 \u2013 IAB-node operation not authorized This EMM cause is sent to the UE if a UE operating as an IAB-node requests service, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a PLMN where the UE, by subscription, is not authorized for IAB operation. Cause #40 \u2013 No EPS bearer context activated This EMM cause is sent to the UE, if during a tracking area updating procedure or a service request, the MME detects that there is no active EPS bearer context in the\u00a0network. Cause #31 \u2013 Redirection to 5GCN required This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests service in a PLMN where the UE by operator policy, is not allowed in EPC and redirection to 5GCN is required. A.3\tCauses related to PLMN specific network failures and congestion/authentication failures Cause #16 \u2013 MSC temporarily not reachable This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests a combined EPS attach or tracking area updating in a PLMN where the MSC is temporarily not reachable via the EPS part of the network. Cause #17 \u2013 Network failure This EMM cause is sent to the UE if the MME cannot service an UE generated request because of PLMN failures. Cause #18 \u2013 CS domain not available This EMM cause is sent to the UE if the MME cannot service an UE generated request because CS domain is not available and SMS in MME is not supported. Cause #19 \u2013 ESM failure This EMM cause is sent to the UE when there is a failure in the ESM message contained in the EMM message. Cause #20 \u2013 MAC failure This EMM cause is sent to the network if the USIM detects that the MAC in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message is not fresh (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19]). Cause #21 \u2013 Synch failure This EMM cause is sent to the network if the USIM detects that the SQN in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message is out of range (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19]). Cause #22 \u2013 Congestion This EMM cause is sent to the UE because of congestion in the network (e.g. no channel, facility busy/congested etc.). Cause #23 \u2013 UE security capabilities mismatch This EMM cause is sent to the network if the UE detects that the UE security capability does not match the one sent back by the network. Cause #24 \u2013 Security mode rejected, unspecified This EMM cause is sent to the network if the security mode command is rejected by the UE if the UE detects that the nonceUE does not match the one sent back by the network or for unspecified reasons. Cause #26 \u2013 Non-EPS authentication unacceptable This EMM cause is sent to the network in S1 mode if the \"separation bit\" in the AMF field of AUTN is set to 0 in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19]). Cause #39 \u2013 CS service temporarily not available This EMM cause is sent to the UE when the CS fallback or 1xCS fallback request cannot be served temporarily due to O&M reasons or a mobile terminating CS fallback call is aborted by the network during call establishment (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.118\u00a0[]). Cause #42 \u2013 Severe network failure This EMM cause is sent to the UE when the network has determined that the requested procedure cannot be completed successfully due to network failure. The failure is not expected to be temporary and repeated request is not likely to succeed in near future. Cause #78 \u2013PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE location This EMM cause is sent to the UE to indicate that the PLMN is not allowed to operate at the present UE location. NOTE:\tThis cause is only used by the network towards UE in NB-S1 mode or WB-S1 mode accessing the network through a satellite E-UTRA cell. A.4\tCauses related to nature of request NOTE:\tThis clause has no entries in this version of the specification A.5\tCauses related to invalid messages Cause value #95 \u2013 Semantically incorrect message.

However, the information element is not required to be present in the message in order for the equipment sending the ESM cause to process the message. Cause #100 \u2013 Conditional IE error This ESM cause indicates that the equipment sending this cause has received a message with conditional IE errors. Cause #101 \u2013 Message not compatible with protocol state This ESM cause indicates that a message has been received which is incompatible with the protocol state. Cause #111 \u2013 Protocol error, unspecified This ESM cause is used to report a protocol error event only when no other ESM cause in the protocol error class applies. Annex C (normative):\nStorage of EMM information The following EMM parameters shall be stored on the USIM if the corresponding file is present: -\tGUTI; -\tlast visited registered TAI; -\tEPS update status; -\tAllowed CSG list; -\tOperator CSG list; and -\tEPS security context parameters from a full native EPS security context (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19]). The presence and format of corresponding files on the USIM is specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]. If the corresponding file is not present on the USIM, these EMM parameters except allowed CSG list are stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME together with the IMSI from the USIM. The allowed CSG list is stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME if the UE supports CSG selection. These EMM parameters can only be used if the IMSI from the USIM matches the IMSI stored in the non-volatile memory; else the UE shall delete the EMM parameters. The following EMM parameters shall be stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME together with the IMSI from the USIM: -\tTIN; -\tDCN-ID list; and -\tnetwork-assigned UE radio capability IDs. The TIN parameter can only be used if the IMSI from the USIM matches the IMSI stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME; else the UE shall delete the TIN parameter. The DCN-ID list consists of DCN-IDs stored together with a PLMN identity. The list can have zero or more entries and the maximum length shall be at least 32 entries. When the maximum length is reached any new entry shall replace the oldest entry in the list. There shall be no duplicated PLMN identities in the list and any existing DCN-ID shall be deleted when a new DCN-ID is added for the same PLMN. The DCN-ID list can only be used if the IMSI from the USIM matches the IMSI stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME; else the UE shall delete the DCN-ID list. The UE shall delete the stored DCN-ID list if the default standardized DCN-ID in the UE is changed. Each network-assigned UE radio capability ID is stored together with a PLMN identity of the PLMN that provided it as well as a mapping to the corresponding UE radio configuration, and is valid in that PLMN. A network-assigned UE radio capability ID can only be used if the IMSI from the USIM matches the IMSI stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME, else the UE shall delete the network-assigned UE radio capability ID. The UE shall be able to store at least the last 16 received network-assigned UE radio capability IDs. There shall be only one network-assigned UE radio capability ID stored for a given combination of PLMN identity and UE radio configuration and any existing UE radio capability ID shall be deleted when a new UE radio capability ID is added for the same combination of PLMN identity and UE radio configuration. If the UE receives a network-assigned UE radio capability ID with a Version ID value different from the value included in the network-assigned UE radio capability ID(s) stored at the UE for the serving PLMN, the UE may delete these stored network-assigned UE radio capability ID(s). If the UE is attached for emergency bearer services, the UE shall not store the EMM parameters described in this annex on the USIM or in non-volatile memory. Instead the UE shall temporarily store these parameters locally in the ME and the UE shall delete these parameters when the UE is detached. If the UE is configured for eCall only mode as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17], the UE shall not store the EMM parameters described in this annex on the USIM or in non-volatile memory. Instead the UE shall temporarily store these parameters locally in the ME and the UE shall delete these parameters when the UE enters EMM-DEREGISTERED.eCALL-INACTIVE state, the UE is switched-off or the USIM is removed. If the UE is attached for access to RLOS, the UE shall not store the EMM parameters described in this annex on the USIM or in non-volatile memory. Instead, the UE shall temporarily store these parameters locally in the ME and the UE shall delete these parameters after detach. Annex D (normative):\nEstablishment cause (S1 mode only) D.1\tMapping of NAS procedure to RRC establishment cause (S1 mode only) When EMM requests the establishment of a NAS-signalling connection, or when EMM requests the lower layers to resume a NAS signalling connection, the RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected according to the NAS procedure as specified in table\u00a0D.1.1. The EMM shall also indicate to the lower layer for the purpose of access control, the call type associated with the RRC establishment cause as specified in table\u00a0D.1.1. If the UE is configured for EAB (see the \"ExtendedAccessBarring\" leaf of NAS configuration MO in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A] or 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]), the EMM shall indicate to the lower layer for the purpose of access control that EAB applies for this request except for the following cases: -\tthe UE is a UE configured to use AC11 \u2013 15 in selected PLMN; -\tthe UE is answering to paging; -\tthe RRC Establishment cause is set to \"Emergency call\"; -\tthe UE is configured to allow overriding EAB (see the \"Override_ExtendedAccessBarring\" leaf of the NAS configuration MO as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A] or 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]) and receives an indication from the upper layers to override EAB; or -\tthe UE is configured to allow overriding EAB (see the \"Override_ExtendedAccessBarring\" leaf of the NAS configuration MO as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.368\u00a0[15A] or 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]) and already has a PDN connection that was established with EAB override. Table D.1.1: Mapping of NAS procedure to establishment cause and call type NOTE:\tThe RRC establishment cause can be used by the network to prioritise the connection establishment request from the UE at high load situations in the network. Annex E (informative):\nGuidelines for enhancements to MS network capability IE and UE network capability IE The UE uses the information elements MS network capability and UE network capability to inform the core network about its network related capabilities. Both information elements can be signalled in any of the modes: A/Gb mode, Iu mode and S1 mode. The purpose of the present annex is to give some guidelines how to select the information element(s) to be enhanced if new capabilities need to be added. 1)\tIf a capability is related to a feature that can be used in a network supporting A/Gb mode only or Iu mode only or both, the capability will be signalled in the MS network capability IE. 2)\tIf a capability is related to a feature that can be used in network supporting S1 mode only, the capability will be signalled in the UE network capability IE. 3)\tIf a capability is related to a feature that can be used only in a network supporting both S1 mode and at least one of the two modes A/Gb mode and Iu mode, the capability is added only to one of the two information elements: a)\tIf the information is used by the MME only, the capability will be signalled in the UE network capability IE. b)\tIf the information is used by the SGSN only or both by the SGSN and by the MME, the capability will be signalled in the MS network capability IE. NOTE:\tThe reason for rules 1 and 2 is that a UE not supporting A/Gb mode and Iu mode will not provide the MS network capability IE to the network and a UE not supporting S1 mode will not provide the UE network capability IE. In some cases, due to rules 1 and 2 the capability indicator will be included in both information elements. EXAMPLE\u00a01:\tThe support indicator for UCS2 is included in both information elements. EXAMPLE\u00a02:\tThe \"SRVCC to GERAN/UTRAN capability\" is included in the MS network capability IE, as it is used both by the MME for SRVCC from E-UTRAN to GERAN/UTRAN and by the SGSN for SRVCC from UTRAN HSPA to GERAN/UTRAN. Annex F (normative):\nApplication specific Congestion control for Data Communication (ACDC) The UE may support the procedures in this annex. If the UE supports ACDC, the EMM layer shall determine the ACDC category applicable to the request based on the application identifier received from the upper layers and the configuration information in the \"ACDCConf\" leaf of ACDC MO as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a024.105\u00a0[35] or in the USIM EFACDC as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a031.102\u00a0[17]. NOTE\u00a01:\tAs an implementation option, the upper layers can determine the ACDC category and send it to the EMM layer. Then the EMM layer need not read the ACDC MO or USIM to determine the ACDC category. The EMM sublayer shall indicate to the lower layers, for the purpose of access control: -\tthe ACDC category that applies to this request if only one ACDC category is applicable; -\tthe highest ranked ACDC category among the ACDC categories that applies to this request if multiple ACDC categories are applicable; or -\tthis request is for an uncategorized application if an application identifier received from the upper layers is not mapped to any ACDC category, except for the following cases: -\tthe UE is a UE configured to use AC11 \u2013 15 in selected PLMN; -\tthe UE is answering to paging; -\tthe RRC Establishment cause is set to \"Emergency call\"; or -\tif conditions MO MMTEL voice call is started or MO MMTEL video call is started or MO SMSoIP is started, is satisfied. NOTE\u00a02:\tThe request from the EMM sublayer refers to either a request to establish an initial NAS signalling connection or a request to re-establish a NAS signalling connection. If the UE supports ACDC and access is barred because of ACDC, the EMM layer shall keep track of the ACDC category for which access is barred and it shall not send a request for the same ACDC category or a lower ACDC category until access is granted. If the UE supports ACDC and access is barred because of ACDC, the EMM layer shall not send a request for any uncategorized application until access is granted.

At change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode due to CS to PS SRVCC handover, ciphering may be started and integrity protection shall be started (see 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a036.331\u00a0[22]) without any new authentication procedure. NOTE\u00a01:\tCS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or from Iu mode to S1 mode is not supported if the current CS security context is a GSM security context. NOTE\u00a02:\tFor emergency calls, CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or from Iu mode to S1 mode is not supported. In order to derive a mapped EPS security context for a CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode, the MSC creates a NONCEMSC and generates the CK'PS and IK'PS using the CS UMTS integrity key, the CS UMTS ciphering key and the created NONCEMSC as specified in annex\u00a0B.6 in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.102\u00a0[18]. The MSC associates the CK'PS and IK'PS with a KSI'PS. The KSI'PS is set to the value of the KSICS associated with the CS UMTS integrity key and the CS UMTS ciphering key. The MSC transfers the CK'PS, IK'PS and the KSI'PS to the MME. The MME shall create a mapped EPS security context by setting the K'ASME to the concatenation of the CK'PS and IK'PS received from the MSC (i.e. CK'PS || IK'PS). The MME shall associate the K'ASME with a KSISGSN. The MME shall set KSISGSN to the value of the KSI'PS received from the MSC. The MME shall include the selected NAS algorithms, NONCEMME and generated KSISGSN (associated with the K'ASME) in the NAS security transparent container for the handover to E-UTRAN. The MME shall derive the EPS NAS keys from K'ASME. When the UE receives the command to perform CS to PS SRVCC handover to S1 mode, the ME shall generate the CK'PS and IK'PS using the CS UMTS integrity key, the CS UMTS ciphering key and the received NONCEMSC value in the transparent container in the CS to PS SRVCC handover command as specified in annex\u00a0B.6 in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.102\u00a0[18]. The ME shall ignore the NONCEMME value received in the NAS Security Transparent Container in the CS to PS SRVCC handover command. NOTE\u00a03:\tThe NONCEMME value received in the NAS Security Transparent Container for the handover to E-UTRAN is not used by the ME or MME in any key derivation in this handover. The ME shall create the key K'ASME by concatenating the derived CK'PS and IK'PS (i.e. CK'PS || IK'PS.). The ME shall associate the derived key K'ASME with a KSISGSN. The ME shall set the KSISGSN associated to K'ASME to the KSISGSN value received in the NAS Security Transparent Container from the network. NOTE\u00a04:\tAlthough this case is related to the MSC server enhanced for SRVCC, the name KSISGSN is kept to avoid introducing a new name for the same domain. The ME shall derive the EPS NAS keys (CK' and IK') from the K'ASME as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a033.401\u00a0[19]. The ME shall apply these derived EPS NAS security keys (CK' and IK'), reset the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT values for the mapped EPS security context (i.e. to the value 0), and replace an already established mapped EPS security context for the PS domain, if any, in the ME, when the CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode or Iu mode has been completed successfully. If the already established current EPS security context is of type native, then it shall become the non-current native EPS security context and overwrite any existing non-current native EPS security context in the ME. The network shall replace an already established mapped EPS security context for the PS domain, if any, when the CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode or Iu mode has been completed successfully. If the already established current EPS security context is of type native, then it shall become the non-current native EPS security context and overwrite any existing non-current native EPS security context in the MME. If the CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode or Iu mode has not been completed successfully, the UE and the network shall delete the new derived mapped EPS security context for the PS domain. Additionally, the network shall delete an already established mapped EPS security context for the PS domain, if any, if the eKSI of the already established EPS security context is equal to the KSISGSN of the new derived EPS security context for the PS domain.",

The UE shall limit the rate at which it generates uplink user data messages to comply with the APN rate control policy. The NAS shall provide the indicated rates to upper layers for enforcement. The indicated rates in a NAS procedure applies to the APN the NAS procedure corresponds to, and the indicated rates are valid until a new value is indicated or the last PDN connection using this APN is released. If the UE supports APN rate control, the UE shall provide the support indication of APN rate control and additional APN rate control for exception data reporting to the network.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings: shall\tindicates a mandatory requirement to do something shall not\tindicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports. The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced document. should\tindicates a recommendation to do something should not\tindicates a recommendation not to do something may\tindicates permission to do something need not\tindicates permission not to do something The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended. can\tindicates that something is possible cannot\tindicates that something is impossible The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and \"need not\". will\tindicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document will not\tindicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document might\tindicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document might not\tindicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document In addition: is\t(or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of fact is not\t(or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of fact The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.",
