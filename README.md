# 3GPP Chat Bot

A sophisticated chat bot application that analyzes 3GPP technical documents and provides intelligent responses about changes, specifications, and technical details through an interactive graph-based interface.

## 🚀 Features

- **Document Analysis**: Processes 3GPP technical documents (.doc, .docx)
- **Semantic Graph**: Creates interactive knowledge graphs from document content
- **AI-Powered Chat**: Uses OpenAI GPT for intelligent responses with caching
- **Visual Interface**: React-based frontend with interactive graph visualization
- **Change Tracking**: Identifies and highlights changes between document versions
- **Smart Caching**: Fuzzy matching for similar queries to improve response times
- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI with real-time chat and graph interaction

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NikBangs/3gpp-chat-bot.git
cd 3gpp-chat-bot
```

### 2. Set Up Python Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 4. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Processing Documents and Generate the graphs
```bash
# From the root directory
cd graph_builder
python main.py
```

### Starting the Backend
```bash
# From the root directory
cd backend
python app.py
```
The Flask server will start on `http://localhost:5000`

### Starting the Frontend
```bash
# From the frontend directory
cd frontend
npm start
```
The React app will start on `http://localhost:8080`

### GUI Graph Viewer
```bash
# From the graph_builder directory
cd ui
python run_graph_gui.py
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Document Processing
Place your 3GPP documents in the `data/` directory:
- Supported formats: `.doc`, `.docx`
- Documents are automatically processed and converted to semantic graphs
- Change detection between document versions

### API Configuration
- OpenAI API key required for advanced chat features
- Intelligent caching system for improved response times
- Fuzzy matching for similar queries

### Performance Optimizations
- Response caching with LRU eviction (max 50 entries)
- Semantic similarity matching for cache hits
- Optimized graph loading and processing

## 🎯 Key Features

### Smart Caching System
- Fuzzy matching for similar queries (85% similarity threshold)
- Automatic cache management with size limits
- Improved response times for repeated queries

### Interactive Graph Visualization
- Real-time graph rendering with D3.js
- Node highlighting based on query relevance
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### Document Analysis
- Automatic section extraction and structuring
- Change detection between document versions
- Semantic similarity analysis for content comparison
